They may have varying levels of familiarity with similar products, so creating a video that is easy to understand for beginners and informative for those with some prior experience is essential. The video will be posted on the product's promotional website and linked in confirmation emails sent to customers after purchase. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc.\n\nNOTE: This video option is for an intermediate skill level with video.

They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. They also expect guidance on specific features or troubleshooting.\n\nThe Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations\u2013like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund.

Your first task is to look ahead to the contracts and projects available and plan for what you want to complete. Consider the point values, skills, outcomes, and your final achievements. What grade do you want to earn? How will you accrue the necessary points to reach that goal? You will write a formal memo containing a proposal's core contents to document the what, how, and why of your work plan this semester.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To strategically select projects and contracts to achieve desired learning outcomes and accrue necessary points.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Review available projects, considering point values, skills, and outcomes.  \n  * Ask 2: Determine your desired grade for the internship.  \n  * Ask 3: Develop a plan to accrue the necessary points to achieve the target grade.  \n  * Ask 4: Explain the rationale behind your project choices and how they align with your learning goals.  \n* \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: Internship supervisor or manager. Write it to me and assume that I understand the parameters of the course, all the projects, and the tools available. I also expect you to be concrete, detailed, and realistic with your plan for being successful in this class. You get to define what success means, so ensure you explain what you want to get out of your time this semester.\n\nThe Style: I want detailed descriptions of exactly how you will accomplish your learning plan, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic\u2019s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners\u2013people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.\n\n* Formal and professional tone.  \n* Clear and concise language.  \n* Goal-oriented and results-driven approach.  \n* Demonstrated understanding of the program and its requirements.\n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: To communicate your commitment to the internship and present a well-defined plan for achieving success during the semester.\n\n* Section 1: Internship Goals: State your overall goals for the internship, including desired skills, knowledge, and experience.  \n* Section 2: Target Grade: Clearly state the grade you aim to achieve.  \n* Section 3: Work Plan: Outline your plan for completing projects and contracts, specifying which ones you intend to pursue and why.  \n* Section 4: Point Accumulation Strategy: Explain how your chosen projects will contribute to accumulating the necessary points for your target grade.  \n* Section 5: Timeline and Milestones: Provide a tentative timeline for completing projects and achieving milestones.\n\nConsider what you want you earn in the course and the focus you want to pursue.\n\n* I want an \"A\"- Earning an 'A' requires 40 points, with at least 4 points from each project group. The most efficient path to this goal is completing every Big Project (26 points) and all the participation (15 points). Then select small projects to make up any lost points.\n\n \n\n* I want to focus on Engineering Projects-While all of the genres, skills, and practices in this course contribute to STEM career paths, I recommend focusing your attention on the following assignments as MORE catered to practical engineering careers (*but you can make any assignment related to engineering*): Reference Library, Tutorial eBooklet, LLM Challenge: Descriptions, AI Challenge: SOP, Progress Report, Recorded Presentation, Recommendation Report, and keep up with all the participation.  \n* I want to focus on Computer Science and Dev Projects- While all of the genres, skills, and practices in this course contribute to STEM career paths, I recommend focusing your attention on the following assignments as MORE catered to digital and computer application careers (*but you can make any assignment relate to CS*): Reference Library, Technical Video or Video Demo, Tutorial eBooklet, Prototype Brief, Progress Report, Usability Report, and keep up with all the participation.  \n* I want to spend minimal time and effort while still passing--Respect. The lower-point assignments are also easier and faster to complete because they require less creativity and concept application (but you will still practice the core skills). If you want to get by with a passing \"C\" grade in an efficient, easy way, I recommend focusing on all the participation points and a few small projects to earn your 20 total points.  \n* I'm a technical writing major or minor: Yay! Happy to have you in the program! You should follow the \"A\" path to get experience across all the major contexts. And then complete the Text Tools Challenge and the Design Tools Challenge to practice with our core software.\n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Proposal](https://www.unco.edu/research/pdf/grant-writing-websites-docs/developing-and-writing-proposals/AliceReidGuide.pdf)  \n* Format: Text-based document contained within a [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 364, "end_char_idx": 6183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f19cd05-c41a-49ce-b1b3-a7c214f2f2bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f19cd05-c41a-49ce-b1b3-a7c214f2f2bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "LearningProposal.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52235e90-28e3-4924-ada4-e4e0eeb1fa45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "LearningProposal.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "8ce856bb75a76545504e762f39a0fb89db88640ab522cd14323fb7e4aa95930d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0debe22d-284a-43da-8c82-89ef8cd5a7f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "LearningProposal.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Project Scope"}, "hash": "f45e7cf1681043140d5326a63b0e972ae72263591bf2973d63770234c43e873a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e99f7022-c9df-4f1a-b224-2086fb31e4a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "hash": "1f095950f0d57e1c6846d48e834a379fa0252204c10f3fb6fade9cade028efef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Graded Requirements\n\nTo earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo and Use a generative AI to complete the challenge.Produce a memo with the appropriate genre elements, Summarizes the situation appropriate to the ask, Discusses the details as appropriate to the ask, Offers recommendations and action items for the situation\n\n### Requirements\n\nYour project will be graded on the following required elements:\n\n1.

In exchange for the trip and several days away from the office, your boss asks you to create a summary for your colleagues that explains what you learned. You need to develop a report that summarizes the key concepts from each conference session (the materials within a unit this semester), explains how the sessions connect to each other, and offers actions for your team to improve the quality of reports produced. You will create a formal memo summarizing what you learned with the team.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\n**The Goals:** To share knowledge gained from a professional development conference on document design and tools with colleagues.\n\n**The Asks:**\n\n* Ask 1: Summarize the key concepts from each conference session in the module (the weeks within Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3)  \n  * Ask 2: Explain how the concepts from different sessions relate to each other and contribute to effective document design.  \n  * Ask 3: Develop actionable recommendations for the team to implement the learned concepts and improve report quality.  \n    \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: Colleagues at the technical writing firm. They are likely other technical writers, editors, or content developers within your firm. They understand the challenges and demands of technical writing.  Some may be experienced in document design, while others may be newer to the field. Some may be interested in specific tools, while others may focus on broader design principles. They want to know how the information from the conference can be applied to their daily work to improve the quality of their documents.\n\nThe Style: I want detailed descriptions of exactly how you will accomplish your learning plan, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic\u2019s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners\u2013people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.\n\n* Formal and professional tone.  \n* Clear and concise language.  \n* Goal-oriented and results-driven approach.  \n* Demonstrated understanding of the program and its requirements.\n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\n**Purpose Statement:** To enhance the team's understanding of document design principles and tools, leading to improved quality and effectiveness of the firm's reports.\n\n* Section 1: Introduction: Briefly describe the conference and its focus.  \n* Section 2: Session Summaries: Summarize the key takeaways from each session, focusing on practical applications.  \n* Section 3: Connecting the Dots: Explain how the concepts from different sessions relate to each other and contribute to a holistic approach to document design.  \n* Section 4: Recommendations for Improvement: Provide specific and actionable recommendations for the team to implement the learned concepts in their work.\n\nYou only need to pick one of the Unit's this semester to discuss the topics learned within.

They have drafted a proposal and asked you to evaluate the document and provide feedback. You suspect that the group heavily utilized an LLM in creating the proposal, so you asked them to explain their creative process. They provided a video commentary on the edits to reference as you further assess the work. You take all their materials and return a written analysis with comments on their work to help them improve their proposal.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To provide constructive feedback on a potentially LLM-generated document.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Evaluate the draft proposal provided by the advocacy group.  \n  * Ask 2: Provide written analysis and feedback to improve the proposal.  \n  * Ask 3: Write a formal cover letter explaining your work to the client\n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: The advocacy group is the client and primary audience who will read your analysis of their proposal.  They are passionate about their cause and invested in the success of the proposal, may have biases that could affect their judgment of the proposal's effectiveness, and are expecting you to provide objective and expert feedback on their writing.\n\nThe Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don\u2019t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning. You are explaining technical writing standards and the ethics of AI in this case as a scholarly level using sources from class.\n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose: To help a higher education advocacy group refine their proposal for a new degree type.\n\n* Open with a formal cover letter addressed to the advocacy group explaining that you completed the work  \n* Section 1: Briefly summarize the proposal's purpose and context, noting the use of an LLM in its creation.  \n* Section 2: Identify and analyze the proposal's most effective elements. Support your claims with specific examples from the text and cite relevant course materials (textbook, lectures, articles). Discuss how the use of an LLM may have contributed to these strengths.  \n* Section 3: Identify and analyze areas where the proposal could be improved. Consider the limitations of LLM-generated content and explain how these may have contributed to the weaknesses. Support your claims with examples and citations.  \n* Section 4: Based on your analysis, provide actionable recommendations for revising or strengthening the proposal, taking into account the ethical and practical considerations of using AI in technical writing.  \n* Section 5: Summarize your overall assessment of the proposal and reiterate your key recommendations. Discuss the broader implications of AI in technical communication and the importance of critical evaluation of LLM-generated content.\n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Materials to Review\n\n* Genre: [Formal Business Letter](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/basic_business_letters/index.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Formal Case Study Analysis](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/writing-case-study-analysis)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\nDownload a personal copy of the proposal and review your client's video on their creative process to complete the project.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 391, "end_char_idx": 4737, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "343863ef-a5ac-4108-8a85-1f23accd7796": {"__data__": {"id_": "343863ef-a5ac-4108-8a85-1f23accd7796", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "LLMChallengeReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f0355c4-810f-4fdd-a37f-99b28e09e475", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "LLMChallengeReport.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "9e590010a6bf98dfdd214e2001d3f9abf4e6131ada6df85e2922ee116459cfe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "188e2d37-1252-42b8-b90a-d8291545b072", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "LLMChallengeReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Project Scope"}, "hash": "5d7a829428d5ef763f4496fc44905b1150a7b50221ed9669e459f332a92db634", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b88360f2-5557-4a70-a209-bebf2ed6c0b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "hash": "6ebfb4aa5adb2952505260afe15d6c17e843130aadae055dcf2ff22e36e31981", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Graded Requirements\n\nTo earn full credit, you need to Write a formal cover letter that summarizes the report addressed to a relevant stakeholder, Analyze the SWOT of the proposal, Cite research with information about technical writing that sets up the logic, value, and application, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfill the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts. \n\n### Requirements\n\nYour project will be graded on the following required elements:\n\n1.

These inventions exist only as text, and their potential remains untapped. Your task is to bring these concepts to life. Based solely on the technical description, create a hand-drawn sketch, diagram, or schematic of the invention. This draft should capture the core functionality and design as you interpret it. Refine your hand sketch into a detailed and polished digital draft using your preferred digital tools (CAD software, 3D modeling, etc.). This should be a presentation-ready visual representation of the invention that we can show the rest of the company at the end of creativity day.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site.

This is your chance to secure funding for a STEM, education, or health-focused project that addresses a pressing social challenge on behalf of your think tank and firm.

The competition requires you to submit a compelling verbal proposal as a pitch video for investors and legislators. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc.\n\nNOTE: The top 5 pitches will advance to the voting round of the competition, where the public provides input. The top 3 pitches will be awarded for their work to claim on portfolios.**Seriously though, I will decide on the Top 5 in the class to advance to a voting round with your classmates (not the actual public). I will send out a form with the pitches for the class to review and vote for the last two weeks of class.

This is your most critical audience, as they hold the power to decide whether your project receives funding. They are likely to be a mix of individuals with expertise in STEM, education, health, social impact, and investment. They want to see fresh, creative solutions to pressing social challenges. Your idea needs to stand out. They'll evaluate your project based on its potential to create meaningful, positive change in the community. While your project has a social good focus, the judges will also be looking for evidence of a sound plan, including feasibility, scalability, and potential for long-term impact.\n\nThe Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations\u2013like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  \n\n* Engaging and enthusiastic tone.  \n* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  \n* Visually appealing and dynamic presentation.  \n* Use of storytelling and relatable examples.\n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: To produce a high-quality video demonstrating the project's potential to create positive social change and address a critical need.\n\n* Section 1: Problem Definition: Clearly define the social challenge and its impact.  \n* Section 2: Solution Overview: Present the project idea and explain how it addresses the problem.  \n* Section 3: Impact and Feasibility: Highlight the potential benefits and demonstrate the project's feasibility.  \n* Section 4: Call to Action: Persuade the judges to invest in the project and support its implementation.  \n* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.\n\nTopic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site.\n\n* Idea 1: STEM: Develop a program that provides STEM education and mentorship to underprivileged youth, promoting equity and access to opportunities.  \n* Idea 2: Education: Create an online platform that offers accessible and culturally relevant educational resources for marginalized communities.  \n* Idea 3: Health: Design a mobile health clinic that provides healthcare services to remote and underserved areas, improving health outcomes and reducing disparities.\n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Recorded Presentation](https://www.techsmith.com/blog/record-a-presentation/?srsltid=AfmBOorHRl67dI5weMFcv-14iKcF_V7MtPT5g9fg09jg62fl1tTdpaIM)  \n* Format: Video (3-6 minutes) hosted on a platform like YouTube, Vimeo, or Stream.  \n* Design: High-quality visuals and audio.

This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To create an informative and educational portfolio that showcases projects, genres, and concepts in technical writing and presentation\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Select 5 technical writing genres or concepts.  \n  * Ask 2: Create video or podcast explanations for each genre/concept.  \n  * Ask 3: Gather examples of each genre/concept (potentially using your own projects).  \n  * Ask 4: Develop descriptions for each genre/concept, including audience, definition, features, and best practices.  \n  * Ask 5: Build a shareable digital portfolio to house all the content.  \n  * Ask 6: Reflect on the process in a project completion report\n\n \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who:  Potential clients of the technical writing firm (businesses, organizations, individuals). They will want a focus on how the technical topic can be applied to real-world problems and challenges they face. They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. \n\nThe Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations\u2013like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  \n\n* Informative and engaging.  \n* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  \n* Visually appealing and easy-to-navigate portfolio.  \n* Professional and credible presentation.\n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: To show potential clients that technical writing is essential for success and that the firm has the expertise to meet their needs.\n\nKey Content: \n\n* Section 1: Introduction: Overview of technical writing and its importance.  \n* Section 2: Genre/Concept 1: Video/podcast explanation, example, description (audience, definition, features, best practices).  \n* Section 3: Genre/Concept 2: (Repeat format from Section 2)  \n* Section 4: Genre/Concept 3: (Repeat format from Section 2)  \n* Section 5: Genre/Concept 4: (Repeat format from Section 2)  \n* Section 6: Genre/Concept 5: (Repeat format from Section 2)  \n* Section 7: Call to Action: Encourage potential clients to contact the firm for their technical writing needs.  \n* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.\n\nReview your projects, readings, labs, and work this semester. You can select any of your projects as a genre or writing concepts.\n\n* Wikis and Reference Libraries  \n* Tutorials, Procedures, and Manuals  \n* Technical Reports  \n* Progress Reports  \n* Retrospectives and Project Management  \n* CRAP Design Principles  \n* Technical Graphics  \n* CAMP Analysis\n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Digital portfolio](https://www.wix.com/blog/digital-portfolio-examples)  \n* Format: Website or online platform (Microsoft Sway, Google Sites, Coda, etc.)  \n* Design: Clear organization and easy navigation. Multimedia elements (videos, podcasts) integrated seamlessly. Quality audio and visuals of the project examples.

The product could be physical (a gadget, a tool, an apparel item) or digital (an app, a software platform, software-as-service). The document you create allows everyone--devs, stakeholders, managers, researchers--to understand the big picture of the product and key details necessary to develop prototypes. The details of your spec sheet will depend on the product type and your role: UX will focus on the experience and design specs, Coders will focus on the language and software specs, Engineers will focus on the functions and physicality, etc. Use the resources to help determine the essential details relevant to your field and product type in the development specification sheet.  \n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site.

A client asked the think tank to help them decide between two potential solutions to an issue with sustainability, equity, or economic impacts in their field. Given the current technological, social, and economic climate, you\u2019ve found the leading TWO solutions and are researching the best option. You address a formal letter to the actual organization or person who influences this field (the stakeholder who contracted the think tank). Your letter needs to identify the work filled in and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and oriented toward actions. Then, the report shows the highest level of formality with background research, clear methods, data for each criterion used to compare the solutions, and the final recommendation.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goal:  To conduct thorough research and analysis to determine the most suitable solution considering the current technological, social, and economic climate.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Identify the top two solutions to the client's issue.  \n  * Ask 2: Develop clear criteria for comparing the solutions.  \n  * Ask 3: Conduct in-depth research on each solution, considering their feasibility and impact.  \n  * Ask 4: Analyze each solution against the defined criteria using data and evidence.  \n  * Ask 5: Formulate a clear recommendation with justification.  \n  * Ask 6: Write a formal letter to the client, highlighting the credibility and value of the report.\n\n \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: The client organization or individual who contracted the think tank. This could be a government agency, a business leader, or a prominent figure in the relevant field with the authority to make decisions based on your recommendations. They will be concerned with the ROI and feasibility of the solution. They will also expect clear, actionable recommendations with a strong justification.\n\nThe Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don\u2019t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning.\n\n* Formal and professional tone for both the report and letter.  \n* Clear, concise, and objective language in the report.  \n* Persuasive and confident tone in the letter.  \n* Use of visuals (charts, graphs, screenshots) to support findings.\n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose: To provide the client with a well-researched, data-driven recommendation on the most suitable solution to their problem, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n\n* Formal Letter: Summarize the project, highlight key findings, and persuade the client of the report's value and credibility (this will be the cover of your document)  \n* Section 1: Introduction: Clearly define the client's issue and the scope of the research.  \n* Section 2: Background Research: Provide context by summarizing existing literature and data related to the issue and potential solutions.  \n* Section 3: Methodology: Describe the criteria used to evaluate the solutions and the data sources used for analysis.  \n* Section 4: Solution Analysis: Present a detailed analysis of each solution against the defined criteria, supported by data and evidence.  \n* Section 5: Recommendation: Clearly state the recommended solution and provide a strong justification based on the analysis.\n\nTopic Choices: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:\n\n* Idea 1: Sustainability: A city government needs to choose between implementing a congestion charge or investing in public transportation to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.  \n* Idea 2: Equity: A technology company is deciding between two different approaches to increase diversity and inclusion in its workforce.  \n* Idea 3: Economic Impacts: A national government is considering two different policies to stimulate economic growth after a recession.  \n* \n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal Business Letter](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/basic_business_letters/index.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Formal recommendation report](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/longreports/)  \n* Format: Written report in 12-20 single-spaced pages TOTAL (including all front, body, and back matter). The font should be a professional and standard 11-14 body size in classic serif or sans-serif.   \n* Design: Highly professional and visually appealing. Clear headings, subheadings, and consistent formatting. Use of tables, charts, and graphs to present data effectively.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 622, "end_char_idx": 6157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71f860e0-c382-4498-8d72-e2a8c330909a": {"__data__": {"id_": "71f860e0-c382-4498-8d72-e2a8c330909a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "RecommendationReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d01ff277-5c01-40c9-968a-68cd2521efc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "RecommendationReport.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "ebb252e83dc1cd10c34423c5a75007d3c66aa51f0921d39e04ffc1a6bf935845", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f834795-976e-4d1e-b49f-fac8a784aaf5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "RecommendationReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Project Scope"}, "hash": "e1ee1818dce12d3aa87af4d50bae713b6f7fed9d98191645f7ff58ba15a894de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4be83ca7-e0cc-41e4-bf59-03538b3c0979", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "hash": "6ebfb4aa5adb2952505260afe15d6c17e843130aadae055dcf2ff22e36e31981", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Graded Requirements\n\nTo earn full credit, you need to Write a formal cover letter that summarizes the report addressed to a relevant stakeholder, Create a descriptive title page and abstract, Create professional navigation: table of contents and list of figures, Explain the purpose of a recommendation report with context on the problem at hand,Identify the logistics and factors important to evaluating a solution as a distinct section prior to any results or data reporting, Conduct primary research to generate appropriate new data from Expert Interviews, Surveys, Case Studies, or Experiments., Evaluate solutions to a problem based on set standards (direct comparison), Cite research with information that helps audiences identify the sources, Generate appropriate visuals that help tell a data story for readers to process, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfilled the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts\n\n### Requirements\n\nYour project will be graded on the following required elements:\n\n1.

Internal and external users find the documents confusing, poorly organized, and lacking essential information. The engineers find the content oversimplified, while the business side feels everything is too jargon-laden for most audiences. The documentation for this product must serve all the stakeholders in the best way possible (engineering team, business team, and end-users/customers). As a technical writer, you have been tasked with assessing the situation and providing suggestions for them to improve their work. You will identify and analyze current research articles on relevant topics (*use the provided articles from the weekly readings OR locate new ones*), synthesize key findings, and apply them to a practical workplace scenario. You will produce a Visual Research Brief with citations of the articles and the project completion report.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site.

This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goal:  To apply relevant research findings to provide practical solutions for improving the documentation.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Assess the current state of the product documentation.  \n  * Ask 2: Identify and analyze relevant research articles on topics related to technical communication, user experience, and information design.  \n  * Ask 3: Synthesize key findings from the research and apply them to the client's situation.  \n  * Ask 4: Create a Visual Research Brief summarizing the research and recommendations.  \n  * Ask 5: Write a project completion report for the firm manager.\n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: This is likely a project manager, documentation lead, or someone in a similar role within the client's organization. They have the authority to implement your recommendations. They will be concerned with overall product success, balancing the needs of different stakeholders (engineering, business, customers), receptive to data-driven recommendations and clear action plans.\n\nThe Style: You should write your brief in an [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don\u2019t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic.

Discuss the potential impact of your proposed revisions on user experience and satisfaction.  \n3. A reference list (and you need to cite the work inside your brief) with 8+ relevant research articles.  \n   1. You can use the research articles from the weekly readings and/or locate your ACADEMIC-level articles. Any industry or popular sources (websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, etc.) will not be accepted for this assignment because you practice applying scholarly research-level papers.\n\nYou are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.\n\n### Grading Criteria\n\nThe project is worth a maximum of 4 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:\n\n* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.  \n* Implemented design tools to produce a highly visual brief in either a graphic word processor style OR a slidedoc style. The audience should recognize this as a visual, written brief.  \n* Cites at least 8 sources that clearly relate to technical writing. The citations are informative hyperlinks, footnotes, or in-text/reference list. These references are synthesized to draw connections to the documentation library problem and used to justify the proposed changes. The data supports the brief.  \n* Explains how to improve the library by outlining the problem at hand, proposing a revision plan supporting by research, and discussing the impacts of the revisions on user experience to justify the recommendations.  \n* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  \n* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5357, "end_char_idx": 8961, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70dd99a0-eb79-4082-875c-ccc072bdbe8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "70dd99a0-eb79-4082-875c-ccc072bdbe8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "ResearchVisualBrief.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa2b4154-90a6-417e-9562-ddb829fdfbb7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "ResearchVisualBrief.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "e9b21feb237eb37e9ad3a190ff8052768510395161138c433e7e8b39cde875e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a55a820-c51c-4792-97e4-fadf3c681a6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "ResearchVisualBrief.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "hash": "5592eadebfc5f4b325932dc1ed8522c73c8e4cc192009d192a8a4e84253ae4d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f17074b-0175-43c3-8a8a-c017f0d47b23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Skills and Outcomes"}, "hash": "81a70a7d4cf72077789d1479b75ebcb7554785490c1e19f13c5f4c1e9b891a22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Due Date\n\nSubmit your work by April 26.

If you are experiencing a mental health emergency (i.e., you do not feel physically safe), call:\n* UCCS Public Safety at 719-255-3111 or call 988 or 911\n* National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 800-273-8255 or text HELLO to 741741\n* Colorado Crisis Services 844-493-8255, text TALK to 38255 \n### WEATHER CLOSURES\nWhen the campus is closed, your lab is canceled. If the campus is on a delayed opening, the lab will be held depending on the delay. For example, when the university is on a two-hour delay until 10 a.m., a lab that begins at 9:25 a.m. will not meet that day. \n\n### Late Work\n\nEvery assignment has a due date and an automatic 48-hour extension before it closes. Work will only be accepted while the assignment is still open on Canvas. All work will be submitted through Canvas, so please don\u2019t email me copies. All assignments will be submitted as a PDF file to Canvas.\nLate work will be graded without penalty, but submitting all your work on time receives an end-of-semester bonus of 1 point.\nGrades are typically posted within ten (10) working days of the due date. If you want to earn more points OR miss an assignment, plan to complete the alternative opportunities to reach your desired grade. You also have one revision opportunity and one super-extension to correct mistakes or complete skipped work. Other priorities, emergencies, procrastination, and life happens: move on if you miss something or score low and plan for the next chance.\n\n### AI\n\nLLMs are a big tool for writing-focused work with growing research and guidelines. They boost the creative process, spark ideas, and expedite drafting. You will see citations and disclosures from me when I use AI tools, too (I like Gemini the best because of the multiple versions and interface and Grammarly for editing support). AI tools are allowed to support your critical thinking, research, and creative efforts. You must review and edit the AI-generated content to reflect your goals\u2014and check for hallucinations, inaccuracies, bias, and empty language. You are responsible for using it ethically, checking all references it provides, and citing the AI-generated content. \n\nPlease disclose AI usage for any substantial content maintained in your documents.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4352, "end_char_idx": 8285, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d587142b-3c5b-4b6a-a2b2-f9dfe0887c4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d587142b-3c5b-4b6a-a2b2-f9dfe0887c4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Resources and Help"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32494fd3-cf0a-4eb8-81c1-695d2cf1bf70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "8fb12f09283a6b39e7b97ff1a0500203bddc7e42857925d1cf326bfacaf28abc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b1f69c6-c26a-4c3d-9eac-4f776e1335f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Policies"}, "hash": "40aa63e2f07833c8436732e450ea01d419ad4193c7224e9aafeea3914b6c401a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46213a51-3381-4aef-9551-9212bf8b4e56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Assignments and Projects"}, "hash": "0f0ea8a0f33a578ae530da1fee80f750cc967b6efb71877a9c71ec4b3ff9eabd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Resources and Help\n* Grab a meeting anytime using our Outlook Calendar tool or DM me on Teams.

Everything is provided for free with multiple formats (media based or transcript reading).\nEvery 2(ish) weeks, you have an opportunity to earn points with a project. You don\u2019t have to complete every project, but you do need to keep track of your points earned compared to your grade goal: an A = 40 points with 4+ points in every skill group.\n\nThe assignment portals on Canvas contain detailed instructions, due dates, resources, and rubrics. Below is an overview of the project categories.\n\n### GROUP 1: SQUARES: DESCRIBING CONTENT\nBuild documentation for products, processes, or concepts. You will demonstrate technical writing strategies for technical descriptions, specifications, graphics, and LLM prompting to describe content. You will choose from a Description Wiki, a Line Drawing AI Challenge, a Prototype Brief, and a Documentation Replication project. I recommend completing the Descriptions Wiki (6pts) and one alternative project. \n\n* Reference Library Wiki due on February 22\n* LLM Challenge: Descriptions due on February 22\n* Text Tools Challenge due on February 22\n* Prototype Brief due on February 22\n\nAll of the projects in this group are due on the same day. You need to plan ahead and make choices with what or how you plan to complete the projects of interest. Remember that the due date is the final day to submit...not necessarily when you have to wait to start something.\n\n\n### GROUP 2: CIRCLES: SUPPORTING ACTIONS\nCreate instructional materials. You will use technical writing strategies for commands, graphics, and LLM prompting to support user actions directly. You will choose from a Tutorial eBooklet, a Progress Report, a Standard Operating Procedure AI Challenge, and a Safety Poster Replication. I recommend completing the Tutorial eBooklet (6pts) and one alternative project.\n\n* Tutorial eBooklet due on March 22\n* Graphic Tools Challenge due on March 22\n* LLM Challenge: SOP due on March 22\n* User Guide Analysis due on March 22\n\nAll of the projects in this group are due on the same day. You need to plan ahead and make choices with what or how you plan to complete the projects of interest. Remember that the due date is the final day to submit...not necessarily when you have to wait to start something.\n\n### GROUP 3: DIAMONDS: REPORTING DATA\nCreate technical reports. You will use technical writing strategies for research, data analysis, graphics, and LLM prompting to report data. You will choose from a Recommendation Report, Usability Report, Research Brief, or Report Assessment of an AI document. I recommend completing EITHER the Recommendation Report or the Usability Report (8pts) and one alternative.\n\n* Recommendation Report due on April 26\n* Usability Report due on April 26\n* Research Brief due on April 26\n* Report Assessment Challenge due on April 26\n\nAll of the projects in this group are due on the same day. You need to plan ahead and make choices with what or how you plan to complete the projects of interest. Remember that the due date is the final day to submit...not necessarily when you have to wait to start something.\n\n### GROUP 4: CAMERAS: PRODUCING MEDIA\nVerbally and visually explain a technical subject using multimedia tools. You will use technical writing strategies for storyboarding, scripting, performing, and editing to produce technical media. You will choose from a Technical Video (think YouTube documentaries), a video demonstration, a Recorded Presentation, or a Project Portfolio. You only earn the points for one option with the lowest three others being dropped from the calculation.\n\n* Technical Video due on February 15\n* Video Demonstration due on March 15\n* Recorded Presentation due on April 19\n* Project Portfolio due on May 10\n\n\n### GROUP 5: BOOKS: PARTICIPATION\nConsistently engage with videos, readings, and labs to understand core concepts. You will use note-taking and participation strategies to gain information. You can complete a weekly Document Analysis by Wednesday nights and a Learning Check Quiz by Friday nights. I recommend completing both Document Analyses (6pts total, .5 each week) and Learning Checks (6pts total, .5 each week). You can retake the Learning Checks unlimited times for correct responses\n\nYou will complete a lab reflection after attending or watching the stream online. You will receive 3 points for completing 10 reflections. That means you can miss 5 weeks of lab--including canceled days for weather or other reasons.\n.\n#### Document Analysis\nFor this assignment, you will use the Hypothesis (https://web.hypothes.is/about/) tool to annotate an example of a related file. The Hypothesis tool will open in a new window and may request \"authorization\" with your Canvas account. Agree to the connection and then read the file using the tools. Search the Hypothesis Knowledge Base for troubleshooting, or contact Professor HB before the close date. She will respond to specific questions and select prompts in the feedback comment and during the following lab session (for common or outstanding thoughts).\nAs you read the document, highlight and make at least 1 comment on each area (3 total comments). The work is due Wednesdays at midnight. You can earn .5 points from this activity and 6 points for completing all the documents in the semester.\nGraded as Complete/Incomplete based on your accurate, thoughtful engagement with the prompts. Professor HB is seeking personal ideas and connections to show you are thinking about the document.\n\n#### Learning Check In Quiz\nYou will use notetaking and participation strategies to gain information. You can complete a weekly Document Analysis by Wednesday nights and a Learning Check Quiz by Friday nights.  Learning Checks (6pts total, .5 each week). You can retake the Learning Checks unlimited times for correct responses. Due: Friday by Midnight.\nThis quiz covers the material from the required area each week. You have unlimited attempts to complete the quiz until it closes. The quiz results will provide hints about where to find the answers in your notes, so you can review the material and improve your understanding.\n \nThe quiz pulls 4 questions from a bank, so every attempt will show you a new combination of questions. The bank includes questions about the mini-lecture, full lecture, and lab (in-person) content. The final question is an open reflection that I will need to grade--and I will address common questions in the following lab or as announcements.\n \nRemember, the goal is to learn and master the concepts, so take advantage of the unlimited attempts and use the hints to guide your review!\n\n#### Lab Reflections\nYou will write a brief reflection about the lab activities and lessons from that day. In the reflection you need to demonstrate that you paid attention to what we did with specific details from class. If the reflection is too vague, you will not receive credit. You should also use the reflection to ask any questions or clarifications, and professor HB will respond in the feedback.\n\nYou must complete 10 of the lab reflections to receive the 3 points of participation. There are 15 lab reflections available in the semester, so you can miss five of them. Be mindful that weather or other class cancellations count towards this five, unless there are extreme situations.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9028, "end_char_idx": 16446, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8729bd1f-8c3f-4205-898c-c8768e840ed5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8729bd1f-8c3f-4205-898c-c8768e840ed5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Grading"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32494fd3-cf0a-4eb8-81c1-695d2cf1bf70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "8fb12f09283a6b39e7b97ff1a0500203bddc7e42857925d1cf326bfacaf28abc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46213a51-3381-4aef-9551-9212bf8b4e56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Assignments and Projects"}, "hash": "c049255f9903112defa1a6245e30ea2e607db148973a58b17e717d8fa9b6fae9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00c6123e-de2e-4f85-b53d-3f66a657ecb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Canvas Pages"}, "hash": "41d3323e417bb61a4789b77a36bfefe0ae0b3f249d84fe2809c6a360d6e5659b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Grading\nGenerally, our rubrics are broken into Functional, Developing, and Draft categories for each skill area, which awards skill points. Your grade will show up with that number and a descriptor: Top Notch, Complete, Attempt, Incomplete. Please read the written comments to understand your performance instead of placing all your value on a single number. You will also see an overall comment. If you would like annotations and deeper feedback on your writing, you will schedule a project review meeting with professor HB to talk about your work page by page.\n\nThe points you earn correspond to the letter grade I will input, and it all aligns with our 4.0 scale. An \u201cA\u201d requires earning 40 points with at least 4 points in each project category, B is 30 points, C is 20 points, and D is 10 points. The class has a total of 60+ points, so you can pick and choose which assignments to complete. Your grade is NOT A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL.\n\nThe course is graded like a video game. You will earn points (think XP) by completing the assignments (think quests) to level up by the end of the semester. You get to choose what quests are worth the XP. Every 10 points will level you up one letter grade. \n\nOne more time for those in the back: YOUR GRADE IS BASED ON TOTAL POINTS AND NOT PERCENTAGE.\n\nBy choosing the projects and point values you want, I expect the work quality and application to be higher. If you put in the effort and try to apply the content, you will earn whatever final grade you desire. Below are all the assignments and point values for the semester. \n\nIn order to get an A in this class, which is max level, you need to earn 40 points with four points from every skill group area. So basically completing projects well in every unit. You get to decide what combination of projects you want to complete to earn your grade because there are WAY more points available than necessary for an \u201cA.\u201d\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16450, "end_char_idx": 18363, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00c6123e-de2e-4f85-b53d-3f66a657ecb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "00c6123e-de2e-4f85-b53d-3f66a657ecb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Canvas Pages"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32494fd3-cf0a-4eb8-81c1-695d2cf1bf70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "8fb12f09283a6b39e7b97ff1a0500203bddc7e42857925d1cf326bfacaf28abc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8729bd1f-8c3f-4205-898c-c8768e840ed5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "Spring25_Syllabus.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Grading"}, "hash": "de33aad869ecc104a66bf7ee6b4aca4c085f6df2fa7d20cfb51b6cb621b1d8c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Canvas Pages\nEverything you need is on the homepage. There are links to the reading materials, lab work, projects, and contact information. Each week the Spotlight links and announcements are posted first to help you quickly navigate. Otherwise you can access content through the navigation bar.\n\n### Canvas Homepage\nThe homepage built this page to be your hub of content with everything you need\u2013navigation and course progress wise. \n\nSo, your weekly homework, which are things you need to do on your own schedule\u2026 think like an online class\u2026are provided in the Readings/Lecture Materials. I will activate the reading homework each Monday morning for three reasons.\n\n1: Logistically, this homepage is more useable when I publish links as go. You should never be confused or wondering what you need to read that week because you just look at the most recently activities link. The current week will be the last blue hyperlink in the list. Easy.\n\n2: The Readings and Labs materials match together, so I don\u2019t want you to work ahead of the activities. Also, I post a Weekly Announcement to the Reading/Lecture page, so I need everything to go live in sync with each other and as up-to-date as possible.\n\n3: The content has created with 1 week\u2019s worth of work in mind. I want you to take several days to break up the content and not half pay attention while you power through it all in one day. If you do finish the required content early, then you should explore the bonus content OR focus on another class OR give yourself some relaxation and self-care time. Either way, I don\u2019t want you to work ahead and put more content on your schedule and plate than necessary. I\u2019m low-key forcing you to chill out and take your time with this course.\n\n### Canvas Reading Pages\nInside the Reading Page, each week will have the same expectation. I provide the Required Materials, Reflection Prompts, Bonus Materials, and links to Quiz and Document Practice.\n\nSo everything inside this Required Material Box is used of the quiz and directly related to your projects. \n\nEvery single week I give you a note taking guide. It has prompts, reminders, visual examples, and\u2026well just a guide\u2026for everything that week: these required materials, the lab activities, and the bonus activities to help you stay organized with all the content. You still need to take notes on your own and in your own way, I just give you some questions and prompts to guide what you should write down in your notebook.\n\nYou will have a video mini lecture, that's what you are watching right now, so good job finding it with that transcript file as well for you. I try to cap these at 20 minutes to serve as an introduction and warm up for the materials. I recommend watching the mini-lecture first. \n\nThen we get into the full lecture content and you'll choose to either read or listen to the podcast. The content is the same. So if you prefer reading like a textbook, then you can open up our OER textbook that I wrote for this class. If you aren\u2019t really into reading 8,000, then instead you can choose to listen to the podcast. The full lecture will typically run 60-80 minutes because it is meant to be a full lecture but instead of sitting in a lecture hall listening to me you get to do it on your own time, pause, replay, speed up, and take breaks. \n\nThe podcast is available online, on Spotify so you can take it on your phone, listen to it in the car, on your walks, whatever, and most other podcast platforms.\n\nThere'll always be this little scenario based on the required materials. This is just for you to help add context and get to what I call the BIG ACTION\u2026the okay how do I apply some of that information to my life. Just think about your answer, and then when you open them I\u2019ll give you some more perspective or context.\n\nThe second box is Bonus Material. It just adds more context and perspective on the topic but I\u2019m not actively quizzes you on it. Of course the bonus material relates and can help you on the projects but isn\u2019t a direct information set. \n\nI\u2019ll give you another video\u2026 sometimes I will have created it and other times it will be curated from elsewhere because I really found it valuable.\n\nThere's always gonna be a research article about technical writing stuff too. So for this, you'll click \u2018Read from Kramer Family Library,\u2019 it'll take us to the library homepage, make sure you log in with your UCCS account, to download these articles.  I recommend at least browsing through them, even if you don't read every single word, just to practice reading research and to learn that highly academic perspective of these concepts. As an intro-level class, I am going to explain it in broad and intro level ways. The research article is going to be a higher-level and more specific explanation based on data.\n\nThese articles are also part of the research brief project option. So, reading these each week will then make that research brief project a lot easier to do because you will have already read and took notes on everything that you need. It will be a little bit of a sad time to decide at the end you want to do that project and then need to read it all in like a weekend.\n\nAnd then last, you'll always have this document analysis assignment, that this is worth a small amount of points, that just asks you to look through an example document and leave questions and comments. We will circle back to that in a moment when we go through the project options.\n\n\nAnd last, I will always give you other perspectives. You might want to read some other professor's textbook on the subject, because they explain it differently and they'll have different examples. If something didn\u2019t click with how I explained, you might find their chapters helpful.\n\nAt the bottom, I will also give you links back to contact me, so you can chat with me, you don't get your questions answered, a link to our lab lesson plan materials, and a link to your learning check quizzes. \n\n### Lab Pages\nFor the Lab Materials\u2013which are cross-linked on the reading page\u2013I will give you a loose lesson plan with the time frame, topic, and activity that we will do. So if you need to miss class or leave early or whatever, you have an idea of what you missed. I also link the notetaking guide, this is the same one from the reading page, and the slide deck I will use during lab sessions. Finally I will link the recording of the lab session for you. These will get linked on Thursday morning, and I will probably just pick the one \u201cbest\u201d session from my schedule. I have three sections of this class.\n\nThe lab pages are assignments because you will submit the reflections after the day.\n\n### Project and Assignment Pages\nThe final thing is a quick overview of what to expect in the project portal. The name of the project includes a symbol (Square, Circle, Diamond, and Cameras) to represent the major groups. Then the due date and the point max. \n\nCanvas will also show you what you're submitting with the accepted file types. If your work isn\u2019t uploading, check that you have the right file type\u2026basically always a PDF, I will accept TXT and HTML as long as you write in markdown including the source info for your images, etc. (so probably not many of you will want to do that given the types of projects we are completing). The available date includes your automatic 48-hour, no questions asked, no penalty extension. After the available date\u2013the extension\u2013you missed the project and need to pick up a different quest of your XP.\n\nThen you have your brief. So these are all of the details. If you are a little overwhelmed with this view or it's just not opening on your computer well, there is a plain version that you can load and print with all the details.\n\nRead the summary to grasp the scope of the project. Then expand these panels for your situation, required elements, and skills to practice. Use these as a checklist to maximize your points and make sure you don\u2019t waste your own time. Read the skills section to decide if this project aligns with your career and what you want to improve. If it isn\u2019t\u2026then make a different choice OR think harder about your career \u2018soft\u2019 and core skills.\n\nAfter all of the key details, there's just a little product checks. These are just for you to stop and check yourself.\n\nI will most always give you examples and templates.

Your target audience includes high school and university students and those in the early stages of their STEM careers. Your mission is to choose a technical topic that you're passionate about and present it in an engaging and informative way. The video must include narration/audio\u2014so YOU verbally explain the topic\u2014and various visuals to enhance understanding. Your video must include some cuts and edits rather than a single take. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc  \n.  \nNOTE: This video option is designed for those with an existing video experience, skill, interest, and equipment. I recommend selecting the more beginner-friendly options if you have not produced and edited a video before. \n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To create an informative and educational video on a technical topic.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Choose a technical topic that you are passionate about.  \n  * Ask 2: Write a script that explains the topic in an engaging and informative way.  \n  * Ask 3: Create or curate visuals (images, animations, diagrams) to enhance understanding.  \n  * Ask 4: Record narration/audio to accompany the visuals.  \n  * Ask 5: Edit the video, incorporating cuts and transitions, to create a dynamic and engaging final product.  \n  * Ask 6: Reflect on the process in a project completion report\n\n \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: High school and university students, early-career STEM professionals. Some may be highly motivated and advanced in STEM subjects, while others may be just starting to explore these fields. They will want a focus on how the technical topic can be applied to real-world problems and challenges they face. They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. You are welcome to incorporate current trends, memes, or popular culture references (where appropriate) to make the video relatable.\n\nThe Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations\u2013like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  \n\n* Engaging and enthusiastic tone.  \n* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  \n* Visually appealing and dynamic presentation.  \n* Use of storytelling and relatable examples.\n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: To produce a high-quality video suitable for sharing on the client's website and social media channels that educates and fosters interest in chosen topic.\n\n* Section 1: Introduction to the topic and its significance.  \n* Section 2: Explanation of key concepts and principles.  \n* Section 3: Real-world applications and examples.  \n* Section 4: Potential career paths or further learning opportunities.  \n* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.\n\nTopic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:\n\n* Idea 1: The Basics of Artificial Intelligence: Explain the fundamental concepts of AI, its applications, and its potential impact on society.  \n* Idea 2: How Renewable Energy Works: Explore different types of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) and how they generate electricity.  \n* Idea 3: The Wonders of the Human Brain: Delve into the complexities of the brain, its functions, and how it shapes our thoughts and behaviors.\n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Descriptive Educational video](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2021/07/30/developing-technical-videos-genres-or-templates-for-video-planning-storyboarding-scriptwriting-and-production/)  \n* Format: Video (3-6 minutes) hosted on a platform like YouTube, Vimeo, or Stream.  \n* Design: High-quality visuals and audio.

They've requested a graphically designed and informative booklet to help the new students use their productivity apps in novel, supportive ways. They do NOT want general descriptions of how the software works or what it does because the IT Department has already created basic guides and descriptions (plus the software documentation libraries provide this general information, too). They also requested an explanation of the digital accessibility tools available in the app. Your contract is to produce a PDF booklet in a verticle format that guides their students step by step through a tutorial on a student success hack using these productivity suites. \n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To teach a \"student success hack\" using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace tools. This implies you need to find a specific, useful technique that leverages these tools to help students improve their academic performance or organization.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* The client specifically requested that you do not provide general descriptions of the software. You need to explain how to use the tool to accomplish a specific, student-focused procedure.  \n  * You must include information about digital accessibility tools.  \n  * The final deliverable must be a PDF booklet in a vertical format.\n\n \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: New university students. Consider their potential needs and challenges as they transition to college life. They may be unfamiliar with the university's technology resources as their highschool may have been a Google or a Microsoft school, which is different from the university. Assume they have basic computer skills but may not be advanced users of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.\n\nThe Style: They need clear, step-by-step instructions with visuals to guide them through the chosen tutorial, so you should write this product in an [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don\u2019t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic. They just need enough to understand the big principles and get the job done. Be encouraging, relatable, and helpful, and approachable. You can be a little silly and creative because the target audience is first-time first-year students (~18 years old). \n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: You can succeed in college using this specific feature/technique within Microsoft 365/Google Workspace. This tutorial guides you through each step to create XYZ for your success.\n\n* Introduce the \"student success hack\" and explain its benefits.  \n* Provide a clear, step-by-step tutorial on how to implement the hack.  \n* Highlight relevant digital accessibility tools within the chosen application.  \n* Offer a troubleshooting guide for common errors or issues.  \n* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.\n\nTopic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:\n\n* How to organize class notes with formatted headings and collaborate (live-edit) with a classmate in Word/Docs  \n* How to manage assignment due dates in Microsoft Planner  \n* How to track grade changes over the semester with a graph in Microsoft Excel/Sheets  \n* How to set up a study group and schedule virtual study sessions in Microsoft Teams or Discord  \n* How to build a study and time management schedule in Outlook Calendar/Google Calendar  \n* How to create flashcards with different media options in Microsoft Notes  \n* *For other ideas, please confirm with the project manager (Prof HB)*\n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [A prescriptive procedure that offers step-by-step instructions to complete a finished product](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/ctetechwriting/chapter/chapter-5-writing-instructions/)  \n* Format: A digital PDF booklet in a vertical layout  \n* Design: Graphically designed and informative.

You plan and conduct usability testing on their product (physical or digital) with 5-8 participants to collect primary data for analysis. You also conduct a market analysis with secondary sources to understand better their audience, emerging trends in the field, and UX expectations for that type of product. Once you have all the data, you analyze the results and write a formal usability report that prioritizes the issues found and recommends fixes. \n\nYou address a formal letter to the company that contracted the firm. Your letter needs to identify the work completed and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and action-oriented.\n\n*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To investigate user issues with the client's product and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Plan and conduct usability testing with 5-8 participants.  \n  * Ask 2: Conduct a market analysis using secondary sources.  \n  * Ask 3: Analyze the collected data (both primary and secondary).  \n  * Ask 4: Write a formal usability report with prioritized issues and recommendations.  \n  * Ask 5: Address a formal letter to the client, highlighting the credibility and value of the report.\n\n \n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who:  The client company (decision-makers, product development team).  It likely includes individuals like a project manager, product owner, head of UX, or someone in a similar role with the authority to make decisions based on your recommendations. They will be concerned with ROI, product success, and user satisfaction and will expect clear, actionable recommendations with a strong justification.\n\nThe Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don\u2019t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning.\n\n* Formal and professional tone for both the report and letter.  \n* Clear, concise, and objective language in the report.  \n* Persuasive and confident tone in the letter.  \n* Use of visuals (charts, graphs, screenshots) to support findings.\n\n \n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose: To provide the client with a comprehensive understanding of user experience issues with their product and offer actionable recommendations for improvement. \n\n* Summarize the work completed, highlight key findings, and persuade the client to take action based on the report (*this will be a cover letter on the report*)  \n* Section 1: Present insights into the target audience, competitive landscape, and UX trends.  \n* Section 2: Describe the methodology, participant demographics, tasks, and key findings.  \n* Section 3: Analyze the combined data to identify usability problems and prioritize them. Offer concrete solutions and design recommendations.\n\nTopic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:\n\n* Idea 1: Physical Product: A new type of ergonomic keyboard designed to reduce strain and improve typing comfort.  \n* Idea 2: Digital Product: A mobile banking app with features for budgeting, investing, and managing finances.  \n* Idea 3: Website: An e-commerce website selling sustainable clothing and accessories.\n\n \n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal Business Letter](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/basic_business_letters/index.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Usability report](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability-reports?srsltid=AfmBOoryf80UE45ynDHHRmLpPXmfA6SlYb0av-9Pbpx6UHCSCisd-kGx)  \n* Format: Written report, 15-25 single-spaced pages.

You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:\n\n* Follows expectations of a formal cover letter. The content explains the creative process and personal reflections on LLMs in this type of workplace situation.  \n* Completed the front matter: Cover page provides a descriptive title and author information. The abstract summarizes the big picture of every section with a clear explanation of the results.  \n* Completed Navigation: Used document tools for crisp and accurate content that shows major sections and the locations of figures/tables. The alignment, formatting, and labels are polished with professional standards.  \n* Completed introduction and market background: A purpose statement implies the goal and content of the report. The market analysis is summarized with some data points and context. The description and reasoning for why this matters and should be studied is implied but not fully identified. I quickly and easily followed your context and justification for assessing the usability of the app.  \n* Completed methods section: 3-5 testing standards or areas of research are identified. The usability tests are mostly explained but questions exist about how and why the task is measured. I quickly and easily found how you planned to assess the usability and why.  \n* Completed Research: Describes the types of participants, recruitment, and testing protocol details with enough clarity to show research was conducted on relevant people for the app. I believe that you collected data to assess the usability.  \n* Completed Analysis Sections: The recommendation makes sense and is argued based on the data and analysis. The results from each criterion are provided and summarized in the discussion. The prioritization of issues is implied but can be understood.  \n* Completed References: 5 appropriate sources are cited in the text and the reference list following formal APA or IEEE conventions. The variety and use of sources shows dedication to curiosity, validity and diversity of perspectives, and a real deep dive to learn more.  \n* Complete Figures and Tables: Created or curated visuals that are meaningful to the content, data, or key points. Wrote clear story in the caption or surrounding text. The caption expands on the context rather than repeating title information only. I see how you used a variety of technical graphics to show the impact of data and information in the report.  \n* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  \n* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5366, "end_char_idx": 10858, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd05f0dc-1c01-41e6-8de5-9373356efe20": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd05f0dc-1c01-41e6-8de5-9373356efe20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "UsabilityReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "466dfef0-8e2d-42ef-a6f5-c92f8c6bd226", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "UsabilityReport.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "5c660b289890bf9f18f8c6f26598f5267414b4ce58ccabab84b07f4cae85637c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18786188-dfe3-4e25-a559-2deba977a0cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "UsabilityReport.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "hash": "11a69f9ce2205be0ebdf6b60309700e76f81dcc8c6ef4af48c97a3969f6a41b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa9e8ee2-3699-4248-a948-237c482b5f14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Skills and Outcomes"}, "hash": "8aad42223611b6e39830cb65a4d862f2117ae4c94228683bbe335bc991706ea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Due Date\n\nSubmit your work by April 26.

This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*\n\n### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks\n\nThe Goals: To assess the client's existing user guides for a specific product and notice adjustments\n\nThe Asks:\n\n* Ask 1: Thoroughly review the client's current user guides (find an example of a product guide to analyze)  \n  * Ask 2: Conduct audience research to identify the target audience's demographics, technical skills, and information needs.  \n  * Ask 3: Analyze the user guides, considering clarity, organization, language, visuals, and overall effectiveness.  \n  * Ask 4: Develop specific recommendations for improvement, which may include simplifying language, restructuring content, adding visuals, or suggesting alternative formats.\n\n### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style\n\nThe Who: \n\n* Primary Audience: The client company (product development team, marketing team, customer support).  \n* Secondary Audience: The end-users of the client's product.\n\nThe Style: You can write this analysis in an [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don\u2019t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic. They just need enough to understand the big principles and get the job done. Be encouraging, relatable, and helpful, and approachable.\n\n* Professional and objective tone.  \n* Clear, concise, and persuasive language.  \n* Use of specific examples to illustrate points.  \n* Actionable and practical recommendations.\n\n### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content\n\nPurpose Statement: To provide the client with valuable insights and actionable recommendations to improve their user guides, ultimately enhancing user experience and product satisfaction.\n\n* Overview: Briefly describe the project scope and the client's product.  \n* Audience Analysis: Summarize the findings of the audience research, highlighting key characteristics and needs of the target users.  \n* User Guide Evaluation: Provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current user guides.  \n* Recommendations: Present specific and actionable recommendations for improving the user guides, with clear explanations and examples.  \n* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.\n\nTopic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:\n\n* Idea 1: Consumer Electronics: Analyze the user guide for a new smartphone, focusing on simplifying the setup process and explaining key features.  \n* Idea 2: Software Application: Review the user guide for a project management software, suggesting improvements to the navigation and task management instructions.  \n* Idea 3: Household Appliance: Assess the user guide for a smart refrigerator, recommending ways to make the troubleshooting section more user-friendly.\n\n### PRODUCT: Final Expectation\n\n* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  \n* Format: Text-based document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n\n \n\n* Genre: [Short written case analysis](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/writing-case-study-analysis)  \n* Format: Written document  \n* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 393, "end_char_idx": 4802, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ee75d70-7e81-443d-867c-ded204bad9f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ee75d70-7e81-443d-867c-ded204bad9f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "UserGuideAnalysis.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Graded Requirements"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad6f0200-f707-4d5e-b1ed-12fb2f8fb891", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "UserGuideAnalysis.md", "extension": ".md"}, "hash": "985aef918fee986d10d1b70451cd5fb8e70a7f0a5f81907ef879c8f6f7e133d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "465c2ffb-5edc-4d33-ae22-c4adb063512e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "UserGuideAnalysis.md", "extension": ".md", "Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Project Scope"}, "hash": "01dda86139dfb6822efeb68b8465bfd827ce179b40ba787cd3195f8c6d30834f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "def3905a-27f2-4422-9f05-e9c8b60a1b9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Header 1": null, "Header 2": "Due Date"}, "hash": "e66a9873d34b0dad1923c142b299f1548bee3a55a0f7db8397c2cccfbc396f9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Graded Requirements\n\nTo earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo and Use a generative AI to complete the challenge, Discover an appropriate technical writing sample that reflects instructional writing, Analyze the CAMP site for the example, Identify the strategies and design elements present in the discovery, Make recommendations to improve the document, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfilled the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts\n\n### Requirements\n\nYour project will be graded on the following required elements:\n\n1.

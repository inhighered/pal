# Documentation Replication
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the prototype descriptions project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, October 27, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 1-2 hours to complete. 
* You will use the provided copy (the words/content) to replicate the design on the provided image. 
* The longest part will be creating the diagrams, textboxes, and design.

## Grading

You can earn 2 points for completing this project. 

This project is graded pass/fail based on how completely you replicate the photo and the effort in your reflective report. 

### Skills to Practice

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices manipulating text-based processors (Word, Docs) with formatting, images, and diagramming tools
* Practices attention to detail with an eye for visual design elements
* Practices problem-solving and critical thinking to accomplish a clear and specific goal
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

## Requirements

You will replicate a reference site's documentation as closely as possible to practice the various tools for structure and design. You are given the copy (the words) with the formatting removed. In your document, you determine the excerpt in the reference image and then add all the elements to replicate the reference photo as closely as possible. You will submit your .docx or link to docs so I can review your used elements and so you become familiar with all the tools available in Word and Docs. Then you will also upload your project completion report.

### CAMP Situation
You are replicating a portion of the screen shown in the reference image from LlamaIndex's document library. To practice design tools and document structuring, you need to identify the excerpted information and replicate every element shown in the photo inside your document.

The file to replicate and content is linked and provided in the Canvas shell. Please refer to the image and documents.

### Components

The submission will be a pdf of the project completion report and the .docx or link to your Google Doc file with your replication. Your submission will include 2 required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: how you met the objectives of the project
* Process Reflection: why you made your creative choices and challenges you encountered with the tools you used
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field

#### Replication document
* saved as the docx or shared directly from Google docs. 
* Do not upload an image or pdf file because I want to interact with the elements you built.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you probably won't directly replicate work like this. Obviously. But you will likely read documentation--the reference information you had to sort through and understand--and use word processing tools to create documentation. This project is more about the underlying skillsets needed to complete the replication than the product you made.

## Examples and Help

Return to the Canvas assignment page for links to sample projects, templates, worksheets, and guide materials to help you iterate (brainstorm), draft, assess, revise, and proof your projects. 

You have access to the following help information:

* Sample from HB with a Build Video
* Professional example from the workplace
* Templates to fill in the information in a Microsoft Word and a Google Drive format
* Project manual with the written tips and support to read and watch. The content between the podcast and the manual are the same

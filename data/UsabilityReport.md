* 50% or 4 = "Attempt"

* <50% = "Incomplete"

* 0 = Skipped

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you are analyzing data to provide logical, ethical decisions shared in a formal report format.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching and writing a formal solutions-focused report as common in many STEM and business careers
* Practices creating summary and navigational tools that signal formality and usefulness to the reader
* Practices prioritizing and summarizing information for the audience to understand the need for technical knowledge for a problem-solving situation
* Practices problem-solving and creative thinking by recognizing a problem and generating viable user testing data to recommend improvements/solutions
* Practices designing research methods and contributing new data to a decision
* Practices locating and synthesizing information for a data-driven decision-making process

## Requirements

You are reporting primary (you generate data) and secondary research to prioritize usability issues and recommend fixes for products with a client focus. You will write a formal usability report detailing your research results, targeted toward decision-makers in the company/product you tested. You write a cover letter addressed to that stakeholder.

### CAMP Situation
You work for a leading UX Consulting firm that conducts research on products in your field. A client asked the firm to investigate user issues on their products and provide actionable recommendations. You plan and conduct usability testing on their product (physical or digital) with 5-8 participants to collect primary data for analysis. You also conduct a market analysis with secondary sources to understand better their audience, emerging trends in the field, and UX expectations for that type of product. Once you have all the data, you analyze the results and write a formal usability report that prioritizes the issues found and recommends fixes. 

You address a formal letter to the company that contracted the firm. Your letter needs to identify the work completed and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and action-oriented.

### Components

The document will be around 15-25 single-spaced pages TOTAL (including all front, body, and back matter). The font should be a professional and standard 11-14 body size in classic serif or sans-serif. Within the report, you are required to include:

* Formal cover letter addressed to a relevant stakeholder--the company that owns the product
* Title page with all citation information (author, date, publisher)
* A descriptive Abstract or Executive Summary: an overview of the purpose and key content
* Well-formatted table of contents and list of figures/tables
* Orientation to the situation: introduction and market analysis for the product
* Explanation of your testing approach and participants with Research Goals: Clearly define the objectives of your usability evaluation; Participant Recruitment: Describe how you will identify and recruit representative users for testing. You must collect data from at least 6 different participants; Testing Methodology: Select appropriate usability testing methods (e.g., task-based testing, interviews, surveys) and provide the questions/protocol you will follow with each participant
* Discussion of the research: usability findings, prioritization of issues by severity and impact, actionable recommendations for addressing issues, a summary of key takeaways and potential impacts
* Reference List with 5+ sources in APA or IEEE format
* Appendix with the raw materials from your usability testing (scorecards, notes, etc.)
* Provide at least two visuals representing data or concepts (graphs, tables, illustrations, diagrams, renderings)

You must include polished writing, visuals, and design throughout the sections. This dense report must be skippable, scannable, and skimmable for the stakeholder.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, formal report writing varies depending on the situation. Typically, higher-level managers and leaders are responsible for writing the reports and interacting with clients, stakeholders, investors, boards, etc. With usability reports, the authors are typically on the UX and technical writings while the readers will be the devs, designers, and managers. You may not write many usability reports, but you might receive these documents and be expected to understand the purpose, content, and action items.

Note: if you H.A.T.E researching and writing reports, this is an excellent opportunity to evaluate your primary career goals and the responsibilities of that job title.

However, the ability to analyze and prioritize potential issues (and document that work less formally) can be used in your personal, professional, and academic life. When in doubt... figure out the background and search for improvements with decisions on the most to least impactful.

# Usability Report

This project is part of the Research Skill Group (#3), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 3 points. Only one of the report options will count for credit, so students need to select between the Recommendation OR the Usability Report. Do not attempt to complete both as the scope and work is larger than the timeline for this class.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our UX Consulting firm has been hired by a client to investigate user issues on their products and provide actionable recommendations. You plan and conduct usability testing on their product (physical or digital) with 5-8 participants to collect primary data for analysis. You also conduct a market analysis with secondary sources to understand better their audience, emerging trends in the field, and UX expectations for that type of product. Once you have all the data, you analyze the results and write a formal usability report that prioritizes the issues found and recommends fixes. 

You address a formal letter to the company that contracted the firm. Your letter needs to identify the work completed and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and action-oriented.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To investigate user issues with the client's product and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Plan and conduct usability testing with 5-8 participants.  
  * Ask 2: Conduct a market analysis using secondary sources.  
  * Ask 3: Analyze the collected data (both primary and secondary).  
  * Ask 4: Write a formal usability report with prioritized issues and recommendations.  
  * Ask 5: Address a formal letter to the client, highlighting the credibility and value of the report.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who:  The client company (decision-makers, product development team).  It likely includes individuals like a project manager, product owner, head of UX, or someone in a similar role with the authority to make decisions based on your recommendations. They will be concerned with ROI, product success, and user satisfaction and will expect clear, actionable recommendations with a strong justification.

The Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don’t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning.

* Formal and professional tone for both the report and letter.  
* Clear, concise, and objective language in the report.  
* Persuasive and confident tone in the letter.  
* Use of visuals (charts, graphs, screenshots) to support findings.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To provide the client with a comprehensive understanding of user experience issues with their product and offer actionable recommendations for improvement. 

* Summarize the work completed, highlight key findings, and persuade the client to take action based on the report (*this will be a cover letter on the report*)  
* Section 1: Present insights into the target audience, competitive landscape, and UX trends.  
* Section 2: Describe the methodology, participant demographics, tasks, and key findings.  
* Section 3: Analyze the combined data to identify usability problems and prioritize them. Offer concrete solutions and design recommendations.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:

* Idea 1: Physical Product: A new type of ergonomic keyboard designed to reduce strain and improve typing comfort.  
* Idea 2: Digital Product: A mobile banking app with features for budgeting, investing, and managing finances.  
* Idea 3: Website: An e-commerce website selling sustainable clothing and accessories.

10. Provide at least two visuals representing data or concepts (graphs, tables, illustrations, diagrams, renderings)

You are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 8 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Follows expectations of a formal cover letter. The content explains the creative process and personal reflections on LLMs in this type of workplace situation.  
* Completed the front matter: Cover page provides a descriptive title and author information. The abstract summarizes the big picture of every section with a clear explanation of the results.  
* Completed Navigation: Used document tools for crisp and accurate content that shows major sections and the locations of figures/tables. The alignment, formatting, and labels are polished with professional standards.  
* Completed introduction and market background: A purpose statement implies the goal and content of the report. The market analysis is summarized with some data points and context. The description and reasoning for why this matters and should be studied is implied but not fully identified. I quickly and easily followed your context and justification for assessing the usability of the app.  
* Completed methods section: 3-5 testing standards or areas of research are identified. The usability tests are mostly explained but questions exist about how and why the task is measured. I quickly and easily found how you planned to assess the usability and why.  
* Completed Research: Describes the types of participants, recruitment, and testing protocol details with enough clarity to show research was conducted on relevant people for the app. I believe that you collected data to assess the usability.  
* Completed Analysis Sections: The recommendation makes sense and is argued based on the data and analysis. The results from each criterion are provided and summarized in the discussion. The prioritization of issues is implied but can be understood.  
* Completed References: 5 appropriate sources are cited in the text and the reference list following formal APA or IEEE conventions. The variety and use of sources shows dedication to curiosity, validity and diversity of perspectives, and a real deep dive to learn more.  
* Complete Figures and Tables: Created or curated visuals that are meaningful to the content, data, or key points. Wrote clear story in the caption or surrounding text. The caption expands on the context rather than repeating title information only. I see how you used a variety of technical graphics to show the impact of data and information in the report.  
* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  
* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.

## Due Date

Submit your work by April 26. The portal closes on April 28. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you are analyzing data to provide logical, ethical decisions shared in a formal report format.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching and writing a formal solutions-focused report as common in many STEM and business careers  
* Practices creating summary and navigational tools that signal formality and usefulness to the reader  
* Practices prioritizing and summarizing information for the audience to understand the need for technical knowledge for a problem-solving situation  
* Practices problem-solving and creative thinking by recognizing a problem and generating viable user testing data to recommend improvements/solutions  
* Practices designing research methods and contributing new data to a decision  
* Practices locating and synthesizing information for a data-driven decision-making process

In the workplace, formal report writing varies depending on the situation. Typically, higher-level managers and leaders are responsible for writing the reports and interacting with clients, stakeholders, investors, boards, etc. With usability reports, the authors are typically on the UX and technical writings while the readers will be the devs, designers, and managers. You may not write many usability reports, but you might receive these documents and be expected to understand the purpose, content, and action items.

*Note: if you H.A.T.E researching and writing reports, this is an excellent opportunity to evaluate your primary career goals and the responsibilities of that job title.*

However, the ability to analyze and prioritize potential issues (and document that work less formally) can be used in your personal, professional, and academic life. When in doubt... figure out the background and search for improvements with decisions on the most to least impactful.

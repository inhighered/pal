# Project Portfolio

This project is part of the Media Skill Group (#4), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 4 points. The highest score from the media group will be used with the three lowest or skipped dropped. Students should pick the one media and video production project they want to complete.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has recently noticed a trend among potential clients: a lack of understanding of the diverse applications and value of technical writing. Your manager has assigned you to lead a team in developing a project portfolio as an educational tool for potential clients. The goal is to showcase the firm's expertise and the wide range of technical writing services you offer while highlighting the positive impact of effective technical communication on businesses and organizations. You will create a shareable portfolio that houses your video or podcast explanations of 5 technical writing genres or concepts with linked examples. Inside your portfolio, you will describe each idea's audience, definition, features, and best practices. You can use your projects from the semester as examples to verbally discuss the concepts and strategies in videos or podcast/audio clips.

You can host your digital portfolio on any site including Microsoft Sway, Google Sites, Coda, etc. 

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To create an informative and educational portfolio that showcases projects, genres, and concepts in technical writing and presentation

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Select 5 technical writing genres or concepts.  
  * Ask 2: Create video or podcast explanations for each genre/concept.  
  * Ask 3: Gather examples of each genre/concept (potentially using your own projects).  
  * Ask 4: Develop descriptions for each genre/concept, including audience, definition, features, and best practices.  
  * Ask 5: Build a shareable digital portfolio to house all the content.  
  * Ask 6: Reflect on the process in a project completion report

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who:  Potential clients of the technical writing firm (businesses, organizations, individuals). They will want a focus on how the technical topic can be applied to real-world problems and challenges they face. They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. 

The Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations–like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  

* Informative and engaging.  
* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  
* Visually appealing and easy-to-navigate portfolio.  
* Professional and credible presentation.

## Due Date

Submit your work by May 10. The portal closes on May 12. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This is a summative assessment, meaning you reflect on concepts from the entire course. This portfolio asks you to explain course topics while practicing creative thinking and media design.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices technological adaptability by learning/using interactive products  
* Practices writing purpose statements and orienting an audience to the content  
* Practices creative thinking by converting written content into new mediums. Have fun with these-- your audience is interested in non-experts, and your goal is to engage + explain  
* Practices critical thinking and professional awareness for the strategies STEM, Business, and most any workplace writing uses to share actionable, necessary content

I won't pretend that portfolios are common in the workplace for most of your chosen majors. But you may need to explain concepts and build an archive of informational materials. You might also end up in consulting roles with potential clients questioning what value you offer.

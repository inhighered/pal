# Safety Poster Replication
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the safety poster replication project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, October 27, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 1-2 hours to complete. You will use the provided copy (the words/content) to replicate the design on the provided image. The longest part will be creating the diagrams, text boxes, and design.

## Grading
You can earn 2 points from this project. 

* 100% or 2  = Complete
* 0 = Incomplete

This project is graded pass/fail based on how completely you replicate the photo and the effort in your reflective report.

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices manipulating graphic design tools with formatting, images, and color codes
* Practices attention to detail with an eye for visual design elements
* Practices problem-solving and critical thinking to accomplish a clear and specific goal
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset


## Requirements

You will replicate a reference poster as closely as possible to practice the various tools for structure and design. You are given the copy (the words) with the formatting removed. In your document, you add all the elements to replicate the reference poster as closely as possible, with the requirement to change the color scheme to UCCS.

### CAMP Situation
You are replicating this Safety Poster from OSHA to practice using the tools inside of Canva, Adobe Express, or similar graphic designer tool. You will replicate as closely as possible except for the color palette. Your version must follow the UCCS color codes by replacing everything with black #000000, gold #cfb87c, white #ffffff, and grey #565a5c and  #a2a4a3.

See canvas for the poster design file and content to replicate.

### Components

The submission will be a pdf of the project completion report and pdf of your replicated poster with the colors replaced by UCCS codes. Your submission will include 2 required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: how you met the objectives of the project
* Process Reflection: why you made your creative choices and challenges you encountered with the tools you used
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field

#### Replication document saved as a pdf poster. 

Your poster should look like the reference except for the colors all changed to be UCCS themed (black #000000, gold #cfb87c, white #ffffff, and grey #565a5c and  #a2a4a3).

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you probably won't directly replicate work like this. Obviously. But you might need to design a poster, sign, or other document for your office. Don't be the person who makes a terrible poster in Word because you haven't tried the power and ease of graphic tools. This project is more about the underlying skillsets needed to complete the replication than the product you made.

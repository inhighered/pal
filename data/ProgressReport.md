This plain-text file provides the basic information for the Progress Report project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, Nov. 10, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 1-2 hours to complete.

You will need to review your current point totals, consider the remaining options, and establish your plan for the end of the semester. Then, you will write the progress report with time for revisions.

## Grading
You can earn 2 points from this project. 

* 100% or 2  = Complete
* 0 = Incomplete

This project is graded as pass/fail based on the inclusion of the requirements and effort.

### Skills to Practice

This project plan is a diagnostic assessment, which is like a pre-check. I want to capture your comprehension of the future assignment objectives and provide early support or redirection.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices planning and self-evaluation in project management
* Practices accountability and progress tracking in project management
* Practices transparency and formal communication in project management


## Requirements

You will take time to think about how you've been doing in this class, determine if you are on track for your goals, and devise a plan for finishing the semester successfully. By looking at your grades and setting specific goals, you'll become more aware of your strengths and weaknesses and take control of your learning.

### CAMP Situation
An early step in the writing process (and most professional/technical projects) is developing a plan that captures your ideas, and it is common for stakeholders to request progress reports on the work. Project plans and progress reports promote transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making, ultimately leading to successful project outcomes.

I expect documentation on your work so far- with actual progress being made- and a literal plan you can follow to complete the class with the grade you want/need. Your plan must include language, details, dates, and action items for the remaining projects you intend to complete. 

### Components

The document will be around 1-2 single-spaced pages, similar to the project completion reports you've been writing. Within the progress report, you are required to include:

#### Introduction:

* Provide the purpose of the progress report
* Identify your current standing in the course
* Share your goals and needs for the final grade

#### Performance Analysis:

* Analyze your strengths and weaknesses from the projects
* Reflect on factors that contributed to your successes and challenges
* Consider the effectiveness of your study habits, time management, and engagement in class
* Discuss any external factors (e.g., personal issues, work commitments) that may have affected your academic performance

#### Action Plan:

* Identify the projects you plan to complete
* Outline specific, actionable steps you will take to achieve your goals
* Set deadlines for each step in your action plan
* Create a chart to visualize and track your action plan

You must include polished writing, visuals, and design throughout the sections.

## Reason for this Project
Writing formal emails that present realistic and thoughtful plans in the career world demonstrates project management and accountability. Documenting your outcomes, timeline, and logistics in formal writing proves your ability to follow through and hit those goals.

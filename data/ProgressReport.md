## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm asks every intern to assess their work at the mid-way point to plan for the rest of the session. You will take time to think about how you've been doing in this class, determine if you are on track for your goals, and devise a plan for finishing the semester successfully. By looking at your grades and setting specific goals, you'll become more aware of your strengths and weaknesses and take control of your learning. I expect documentation on your work so far- with actual progress being made- and a literal plan you can follow to complete the class with the grade you want/need.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To promote awareness and control over individual learning journeys.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Evaluate your performance in the class thus far.  
  * Ask 2: Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for the rest of the semester.  
  * Ask 3: Create a plan to achieve these goals, including strategies and deadlines.

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Internship supervisor or manager. Write it to me and assume that I understand the parameters of the course, all the projects, and the tools available. I also expect you to be concrete, detailed, and realistic with your plan to succeed in this class. You get to define what success means, so ensure you explain what you want to get out of your time this semester.

The Style: I want detailed descriptions of exactly how you will accomplish your learning plan, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic’s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners–people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.

* Clear and concise language.  
* Goal-oriented and results-driven approach.  
* Demonstrated understanding of the program and its requirements.

Identifying, explaining, and then executing detailed plans/goals is a central part of success in.... well, anything. When people talk about "strong communication skills" for the job, it is often referring to this ability: can you explain and follow a plan to get your job done? Writing formal documentation that presents realistic and thoughtful plans in the career world demonstrates project management and accountability. Documenting your outcomes, timeline, and logistics in formal writing proves your ability to follow through and hit those goals.

# Prototype Descriptions
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the prototype descriptions project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, October 27, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 2-4 active working hours to complete.

* Brainstorm your product with the unique features (1-2 hours)

* Write the description for the product concept, specifications, and prototype visuals (1-2 hours), leaving time to revise your products.

## Grading

You can earn 2 points for completing this project. 

The grade is based on four areas with a high expectation given the resources, support, and material for you to use:

* Area 1 is worth 1 point. You are graded on how successful you are with the required components.
* Area 2 is worth .5 point. You are graded on the overall presentation of your work by considering the editing, design, and overall display of information. If you create an essay, you will score a No Marks.
* Area 3 is worth .25 point. You are graded on the application to the product scenario based on how will your brief fits the Context, Audience, Message, and Product of the assignment.
* Area 4 is worth .25 point. You are graded on the impression and impact, and you will either earn the 'wow' factor boost or not. 

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you describe your idea in useful, usable detail for a specific audience.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking to brainstorm and develop NEW ideas and solutions
* Practices attention to the details that make products/topics/processes unique
* Practices developing visuals to bring an idea closer to the prototype phase (visualizing on paper what you imagine)
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

## Requirements

You will brainstorm a new product (physical or digital) that can streamline daily tasks, enhance convenience, or solve unique problems in everyday life, the workplace, or a specific industry. Your product needs to be original, so it is NOT an existing version of one particular product, and it can enhance, iterate, or change products. For example, you can make a new version of an app with original features you think are missing. Once you have an original idea, you will describe the concept, detail the specifications, and provide prototypic visuals to help the engineering team develop your prototype.

The details of your spec sheet will depend on the product type and your role: UX will focus on the experience and design specs, Coders will focus on the language and software specs, Engineers will focus on the functions and physicality, etc. Use the resources to help determine the essential details relevant to your field and product type in the development specification sheet.

### CAMP Situation
You are trying to complete a project that fills this scenario. 

Your team has developed a new product, but to secure funding, you need a clear and concise technical specifications document that outlines the product's functionality, features, potential impact, and prototype visuals. The product could be physical (a gadget, a tool, an apparel item) or digital (an app, a software platform, software-as-service). The document you create allows everyone--devs, stakeholders, managers, researchers--to understand the big picture of the product and key details necessary to develop prototypes. 

### Components
The submission will be a .pdf that contains the requirements of a basic spec sheet for development. Your submission will include 2 main documents with several required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: how you met the objectives of the project
* Process Reflection: why you made your creative choices and what challenges you encountered with the tools you used
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field
#### A specification sheet with four headings of content:
* Product Overview: Briefly describe the product, its purpose, and its target users.
* Key Features and Functionality: List the product's primary features and how they function to solve your user's problems
* Technical Specifications: Detail the product's technical aspects, such as dimensions & materials (physical products), software requirements and code language/elements (digital products from a CS and coding role), user experience and information infrastructure (app-based products from a UX or technical writer role), or any relevant technical standards. This area will most likely change depending on your career roles and product type.
* Prototype Visuals: Include product sketches, diagrams, flowcharts, or images.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, prototyping and technical specification documentation are invaluable tools. Prototyping allows for the visualization of concepts, identification of design flaws, gathering feedback, improved communication and collaboration, and securing of buy-in from stakeholders.  Technical specifications provide clear guidelines, minimize errors and misinterpretations, ensure quality control, guarantee legal and regulatory compliance, and serve as valuable documentation for future reference. Together, these practices streamline product development, save resources, and ensure the creation of high-quality, user-friendly, and compliant products.

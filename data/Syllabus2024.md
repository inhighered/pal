# Course Details

The course runs in Fall 2024, beginning in August and ending in December. It is a 16-week hybrid course. A hybrid course means that 50-99% of materials are delivered online with some in-person instruction. This class meets one time per week with most content provided in Canvas.

## Course Name and Instructor Information

The course is TCID 2090, Technical Writing and Presentation. 
The professor is Dr. Hayley Blackburn.

You can contact Dr. HB on teams or email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. She is laid-back as a professor and strongly believes this is YOUR education. Her job is curating an experience (including resources, guidance, and feedback) that allows you to practice technical communication. She values curiosity, agency, and productivity. The grading is set up to reward those values while not crushing you for one mistake or missed deadline. Your choices will lead to your outcomes, and she is here if you need more support. 


## Course Summary
This class teaches the basics of technical writing and information design (presenting content) through 10 project options, three (3) reading activity options, and active lab work. Most weeks, you will have work due during class (activities & reflections), Fridays (reading homework), and Sundays (project milestones). You are graded on total points earned and NOT a percentage of the total work. This means you will plan and decide which projects, activities, and skills you want to complete to accrue the corresponding points. 
* A = 40 points with 4+ points in every skill group (Descriptions, Instructions, Reports, Media, & Readings)
* B+ = 40 points. No restriction on where points are earned.
* B = 30 points. No restriction on where points are earned.
* C = 20 points. No restriction on where points are earned.
* D = 10 points. No restriction on where points are earned.
* F = Fewer than 10 points
As a hybrid course, most content is delivered through Canvas and runs similarly to an online class. My teaching style is active, so you are responsible for doing readings, videos, and assignments on your own time while being ready to participate in activities during lab sessions.

When you registered for this class, you saw the goal described as “preparing students to write effectively and ethically within technical, scientific, and engineering contexts by applying best practices for technical communication.” You will practice creating, revising, and analyzing various technical communication genres through discussion/participation activities, creative projects, and reading reflections/analysis.

## Course Requirements
The course is built on several assumptions that you can access materials and hold required skills.

### Skills
 
* Functional skills in standard American English writing: sentence construction, paragraph structure, spelling/grammar with ENGL 1308, ENGL 1310, or ENGL1410
* Functional technical skills for computer and digital interactions 
* Functional digital information literacy to locate, evaluate, apply, create, and communicate knowledge using technology 

### Materials

As a student you get access to Microsoft Office  for up to five devices that you can register, so get that set up on your computer right away. Then go ahead and sign up for your account for either Adobe Express or Canva, you will need these information and light graphic design tools for several projects. They have free versions which is all you NEED.

* Access to your campus email account, Canvas, Office 365
* The online materials are published in Canvas to complete independently. I've provided a required mini-lecture video, a full lecture podcast OR textbook chapter (the content is the same, so you can choose the format you prefer), a notetaking guide, and bonus content each week. 
* The OER (free, open educational resource) “textbook” I’ve written for this class. The textbook includes help pages for the projects this semester to use.
* The technology requirements for the campus. Computers (not Chromebooks or Tablet-Hybrids) are best for this class because we run Office products. You can complete all the assignments in the 365 Online environment…but it is less powerful with a few missing creative features. If you can’t bring a laptop to campus, we meet in a PC lab for class.
* We will use AhaSlides, a participation and polling software. You will access it with a guest QR code during class and do not have to create an account. Ahaslides collects data on our responses, and you will not be asked to give sensitive data during a class poll.

## Policies

### DISABILITY SERVICES (ACCOMMODATIONS) 
I try to create a universal class that accommodates by default. Yet, you might need something I had not considered in the class design. Work with DS to determine the appropriate accommodations for your situation, and let me know how to help. Please get in touch with Disability Services for more information.
### MILITARY STUDENTS 
Please let me know if you will participate in military activities, including training and deployment. I will work with you on the schedule and discuss if the course requirements and meeting times will work with your obligations.
### STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT 
Our code of conduct outlines the ethical and social behavior that underlies the principles of the University. Please do your work and support everyone in our class's learning environment. Note on AI: In this class, you are assessed on applying design and communication tools, not the subject area in your documents. You can use AI to generate and edit the copy (words). Please follow our course AI Policies.
### ACADEMIC ADVISING AND SUPPORT 
Your academic advisors serve as guides, mentors, and support on your UCCS journey. Follow the advising timeline and check in with your support throughout the year. I will also submit alerts to your advisors if I notice a pattern of missing workshops, low scores, in danger of failing the course, or other academic concerns.
### MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING
Mental health challenges can interfere with academic performance. The source of symptoms might be related to your coursework; if so, please speak with me to find a compromise and support. However, many problems go beyond this class and require trained support. If you are experiencing a mental health emergency (i.e., you do not feel physically safe), call:
* UCCS Public Safety at 719-255-3111 or call 988 or 911
* National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 800-273-8255 or text HELLO to 741741
* Colorado Crisis Services 844-493-8255, text TALK to 38255 
### WEATHER CLOSURES
When the campus is closed, your lab is canceled. If the campus is on a delayed opening, the lab will be held depending on the delay. For example, when the university is on a two-hour delay until 10 a.m., a lab that begins at 9:25 a.m. will not meet that day. In the Lab Check, you will state it was canceled, and those points will be skipped.

### Late Work

Every assignment has a due date and an automatic 48-hour extension before it closes. Work will only be accepted while the assignment is still open on Canvas. All work will be submitted through Canvas, so please don’t email me copies. Follow the instructions on Canvas for the expected format and file types accepted.
Late work will be graded without penalty, but submitting all your work on time receives an end-of-semester bonus of 1 point.
Grades are typically posted within ten (10) working days of the due date. If you want to earn more points OR miss an assignment, plan to complete the alternative opportunities to reach your desired grade. Other priorities, emergencies, procrastination, and life happens: move on if you miss something or score low and plan for the next chance.

### AI

LLMs are a big tool for writing-focused work with growing research and guidelines. They boost the creative process, spark ideas, and expedite drafting. You will see citations and disclosures from me when I use AI tools, too (I like Gemini the best because of the multiple versions and interface and Grammarly for editing support). AI tools are allowed to support your critical thinking, research, and creative efforts. You must review and edit the AI-generated content to reflect your goals—and check for hallucinations, inaccuracies, bias, and empty language. You are responsible for using it ethically, checking all references it provides, and citing the AI-generated content. 

Please disclose AI usage for any substantial content maintained in your documents.

## Resources and Help
* Grab a meeting anytime using our Outlook Calendar tool or DM me on Teams. Professor HB turns off notifications and block my calendar after 4 pm and all weekend (outside a standard 40-hour schedule).
* The Excel Centers: the Communication Center and the Writing Center are designed to provide critical academic and individual support to all students in the University in all major academic areas, both within and beyond the classroom. All Excel Centers offer online services by appointment.
* Canvas Support 24/7 Hotline 844-802-9230 or Canvas Support Live Chat 
* Contact the UCCS Helpdesk at 719-255-4357 or contact
* AI tools (we call them interns): Bing, Bard, ChatGpt, Editor, Grammarly, Designer, Adobe, etc


## Assignments and Projects

You will need to watch videos, read articles, and take notes on your own time while keeping up with the schedule. Everything is provided for free with multiple formats (media based or transcript reading).
Every 2(ish) weeks, you have an opportunity to earn points with a project. You don’t have to complete every project, but you do need to keep track of your points earned compared to your grade goal: an A = 40 points with 4+ points in every skill group.

The assignment portals on Canvas contain detailed instructions, due dates, resources, and rubrics. Below is an overview of the project categories.

### GROUP 1: SQUARES: DESCRIBING CONTENT
Build documentation for products, processes, or concepts. You will demonstrate technical writing strategies for technical descriptions, specifications, graphics, and LLM prompting to describe content.

I recommend completing either the video or the presentation (6pts) and the alternative as needed (3pts). 

* Technical Video due on September 29
* Recorded Presentation due on November 24
* Project Portfolio due on December 19


### GROUP 5: BOOKS: PARTICIPATION
Consistently engage with videos, readings, and labs to understand core concepts. You will use note-taking and participation strategies to gain information. You can complete a weekly Document Analysis by Wednesday nights and a Learning Check Quiz by Friday nights. I recommend completing both Document Analyses (6pts total, .5 each week) and Learning Checks (6pts total, .5 each week). You can retake the Learning Checks unlimited times for correct responses
.
#### Document Analysis
For this assignment, you will use the Hypothesis (https://web.hypothes.is/about/) tool to annotate an example of a related file. The Hypothesis tool will open in a new window and may request "authorization" with your Canvas account. Agree to the connection and then read the file using the tools. Search the Hypothesis Knowledge Base for troubleshooting, or contact Professor HB before the close date. She will respond to specific questions and select prompts in the feedback comment and during the following lab session (for common or outstanding thoughts).
As you read the document, highlight and make at least 1 comment on each area (3 total comments). The work is due Wednesdays at midnight. You can earn .5 points from this activity and 6 points for completing all the documents in the semester.
Graded as Complete/Incomplete based on your accurate, thoughtful engagement with the prompts.Professor HB is seeking personal ideas and connections to show you are thinking about the document.

#### Learning Check In Quiz
You will use notetaking and participation strategies to gain information. You can complete a weekly Document Analysis by Wednesday nights and a Learning Check Quiz by Friday nights.  Learning Checks (6pts total, .5 each week). You can retake the Learning Checks unlimited times for correct responses. Due: Friday by Midnight.
This quiz covers the material from the required area each week. You have unlimited attempts to complete the quiz until it closes. The quiz results will provide hints about where to find the answers in your notes, so you can review the material and improve your understanding.
 
The quiz pulls 4 questions from a bank, so every attempt will show you a new combination of questions. The bank includes questions about the mini-lecture, full lecture, and lab (in-person) content. The final question is an open reflection that I will need to grade--and I will address common questions in the following lab or as announcements.
 
Remember, the goal is to learn and master the concepts, so take advantage of the unlimited attempts and use the hints to guide your review!

## Grading
Generally, our rubrics are broken into Very Effective, Functional, Developing, and Incomplete categories for each skill area, which awards skill points. Your grade will show up with that number and a descriptor: Top Notch, Complete, Attempt, Incomplete. Please read the written comments to understand your performance instead of placing all your value on a single number. You will also see an overall comment, written feedback on your rubrics, and annotations on your documents.

The points you earn correspond to the letter grade I will input, and it all aligns with our 4.0 scale. An “A” requires earning 40 points with at least 4 points in each project category, B is 30 points, C is 20 points, and D is 10 points. The class has a total of 60+ points, so you can pick and choose which assignments to complete. Your grade is NOT A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL.

The course is graded like a video game. You will earn points (think XP) by completing the assignments (think quests) to level up by the end of the semester. You get to choose what quests are worth the XP. Every 10 points will level you up one letter grade. 

The gradebook is set-up with 0s in all upcoming projects. This gives you the clearest sense of your current work output and view of the total points you earn. One more time for those in the back: YOUR GRADE IS BASED ON TOTAL POINTS AND NOT PERCENTAGE.

By choosing the projects and point values you want, I expect the work quality and application to be higher. If you put in the effort and try to apply the content, you will earn whatever final grade you desire. Below are all the assignments and point values for the semester. 

In order to get an A in this class, which is max level, you need to earn 40 points with four points from every skill group area. So basically completing projects well in every unit. You get to decide what combination of projects you want to complete to earn your grade because there are WAY more points available than necessary for an “A.”

## Canvas Pages
All right, so I think that is our overall tour and overview of Canvas. Everything you need is right here on this homepage. I will keep publishing things weekly as we go through the semester so it stays tidy and up-to-date

### Canvas Homepage
The homepage built this page to be your hub of content with everything you need–navigation and course progress wise. 

So, your weekly homework, which are things you need to do on your own schedule… think like an online class…are provided in the Readings/Lecture Materials. I will activate the reading homework each Monday morning for three reasons.

1: Logistically, this homepage is more useable when I publish links as go. You should never be confused or wondering what you need to read that week because you just look at the most recently activities link. The current week will be the last blue hyperlink in the list. Easy.

2: The Readings and Labs materials match together, so I don’t want you to work ahead of the activities. Also, I post a Weekly Announcement to the Reading/Lecture page, so I need everything to go live in sync with each other and as up-to-date as possible.

3: The content has created with 1 week’s worth of work in mind. I want you to take several days to break up the content and not half pay attention while you power through it all in one day. If you do finish the required content early, then you should explore the bonus content OR focus on another class OR give yourself some relaxation and self-care time. Either way, I don’t want you to work ahead and put more content on your schedule and plate than necessary. I’m low-key forcing you to chill out and take your time with this course.

### Canvas Reading Pages
Inside the Reading Page, each week will have the same expectation. I will link a YouTube Shorts video with any announcements and reminders for the week. Then I provide the Required Materials, Reflection Prompts, Bonus Materials, and links to Quiz and Document Practice.

So everything inside this Required Material Box is used of the quiz and directly related to your projects. 

Every single week I give you a note taking guide. It has prompts, reminders, visual examples, and…well just a guide…for everything that week: these required materials, the lab activities, and the bonus activities to help you stay organized with all the content. You still need to take notes on your own and in your own way, I just give you some questions and prompts to guide what you should write down in your notebook.

You will have a video mini lecture, that's what you are watching right now, so good job finding it with that transcript file as well for you. I try to cap these at 20 minutes to serve as an introduction and warm up for the materials. I recommend watching the mini-lecture first. 

Then we get into the full lecture content and you'll choose to either read or listen to the podcast. The content is the same. So if you prefer reading like a textbook, then you can open up our OER textbook that I wrote for this class. If you aren’t really into reading 8,000, then instead you can choose to listen to the podcast. The full lecture will typically run 60-80 minutes because it is meant to be a full lecture but instead of sitting in a lecture hall listening to me you get to do it on your own time, pause, replay, speed up, and take breaks. 

The podcast is available online, on Spotify so you can take it on your phone, listen to it in the car, on your walks, whatever, and most other podcast platforms.

There'll always be this little scenario based on the required materials. This is just for you to help add context and get to what I call the BIG ACTION…the okay how do I apply some of that information to my life. Just think about your answer, and then when you open them I’ll give you some more perspective or context.

The second box is Bonus Material. It just adds more context and perspective on the topic but I’m not actively quizzes you on it. Of course the bonus material relates and can help you on the projects but isn’t a direct information set. 

I’ll give you another video… sometimes I will have created it and other times it will be curated from elsewhere because I really found it valuable.

There's always gonna be a research article about technical writing stuff too. So for this, you'll click ‘Read from Kramer Family Library,’ it'll take us to the library homepage, make sure you log in with your UCCS account, to download these articles.  I recommend at least browsing through them, even if you don't read every single word, just to practice reading research and to learn that highly academic perspective of these concepts. As an intro-level class, I am going to explain it in broad and intro level ways. The research article is going to be a higher-level and more specific explanation based on data.

These articles are also part of the research brief project option. So, reading these each week will then make that research brief project a lot easier to do because you will have already read and took notes on everything that you need. It will be a little bit of a sad time to decide at the end you want to do that project and then need to read it all in like a weekend.

And then last, you'll always have this document analysis assignment, that this is worth a small amount of points, that just asks you to look through an example document and leave questions and comments. We will circle back to that in a moment when we go through the project options.


And last, I will always give you other perspectives. You might want to read some other professor's textbook on the subject, because they explain it differently and they'll have different examples. If something didn’t click with how I explained, you might find their chapters helpful.

At the bottom, I will also give you links back to contact me, so you can chat with me, you don't get your questions answered, a link to our lab lesson plan materials, and a link to your learning check quizzes. 

### Lab Pages
For the Lab Materials–which are cross-linked on the reading page–I will give you a loose lesson plan with the time frame, topic, and activity that we will do. So if you need to miss class or leave early or whatever, you have an idea of what you missed. I also link the notetaking guide, this is the same one from the reading page, and the slide deck I will use during lab sessions. Finally I will link the recording of the lab session for you. These will get linked on Thursday morning, and I will probably just pick the one “best” session from my schedule. I have three sections of this class.

### Project and Assignment Pages
The final thing is a quick overview of what to expect in the project portal. The name of the project includes a symbol (Square, Circle, Diamond, and Cameras) to represent the major groups. Then the due date and the point max. 

Canvas will also show you what you're submitting with the accepted file types. If your work isn’t uploading, check that you have the right file type…basically always a PDF, I will accept TXT and HTML as long as you write in markdown including the source info for your images, etc. (so probably not many of you will want to do that given the types of projects we are completing). The available date includes your automatic 48-hour, no questions asked, no penalty extension. After the available date–the extension–you missed the project and need to pick up a different quest of your XP.

Then I have three cards summarizing the key points: when with a general estimate of the time frame, the WHAT you are working towards, and the WHY of grading. By active time, I estimated this based on like “I’m focused and actually, actually working on it.” Not the…I’m watching Twitch and sorta thinking about it type of hours. No shade. Sometimes I take ages to do things because I’m not really being active or focused about it.

Then you have your brief. So these are all of the details. If you are a little overwhelmed with this view or it's just not opening on your computer well, there is a plain text version that you can load and print with all the details.

Read the summary to grasp the scope of the project. Then expand these panels for your situation, required elements, and skills to practice. Use these as a checklist to maximize your points and make sure you don’t waste your own time. Read the skills section to decide if this project aligns with your career and what you want to improve. If it isn’t…then make a different choice OR think harder about your career ‘soft’ and core skills.

After all of the key details, there's just a little product checks. These are just for you to stop and check yourself.

I will most always give you examples and templates. If you open them up, you can grab my Sample of the project with a Speedbuild video of me making the sample. I will explain what tools I’m using and give little tips on the process. You can also see past student samples and workplace examples–so how do these skills and document show up in the professional world compared to our obviously ‘mock’ situations that I crafted to practice really key things and more standard or ‘proper’ strategies.

I also provide an FAQ section, this project manual where I get more detailed with how to complete the project. That is for when you feel really lost or inspired, I sort of walk more step by step what you could do. And you have a Word and Google Doc template. Mostly I recommend using Office products because they are more suited and powerful for this type of work but either generally gets the job done.

And then this project checklist that is just to help you evaluate your work before submitting. It is a reminder of what you should do to help boost your points AND answering these questions can help you with the project completion reports that you will write for basically every project.

Finally, the rubric will be posted. It typically will break down like 50% for the requirements, 30% for the presentation (editing and design), 10% for the CAMP application (did you create something that actual fits the audience situation I provided or is just random), and 10% for overall Impression and Impact (that WOW factors that…all of you CAN score but typically only 20% do just because only about 20% will care enough to put that much effort, creativity, and application into the work). 

No shade. I get it. But I will acknowledge that more impressive work with the final 10% score.

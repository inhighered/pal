When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking while manipulating the tools for a customized deck
* Practices delivery skills and ensures the audience can hear your ideas
* Practices leveraging persuasive appeals to support learning about topics
* Practices designing a handout to accompany presentations


## Requirements
You will pitch an idea for social good, anything related to science, technology, engineering, math, education, or health that will improve society, as a recorded presentation with highly visual slides to complement your verbal explanations. Your pitch for the idea to enhance our community will be 3 to 6 minutes long and targeted towards 'investor' or 'legislator' type audiences.

### CAMP Situation
The local "Pitch for Good" competition has issued its CFP and theme. This is your chance to secure funding for a STEM, education, or health-focused project that addresses a pressing social challenge.  The judges are looking for novel ideas that clearly connect to equity, sustainability, and other cultural issues to improve conditions for the most amount of people. The competition requires you to submit a compelling verbal proposal, including a 3-6 minute pitch video aimed at investors and legislators. The competition is fierce, but you are determined to make your mark and create a lasting impact on your community.

The top 5 pitches will advance to the voting round of the competition, where the public provides input. The top 3 pitches will receive an award for their work to claim on portfolios.

**Seriously though, I will decide on the Top 5 in the class to advance to a voting round with your classmates (not the actual public). I will send out a form with the pitches for the class to review and vote for the last two weeks of class. Winners will be announced during finals week and will receive 1 point plus a certificate for your LinkedIn portfolios. If you are selected, you can opt out if you don't feel comfortable.**

## Reason for this Project
Formal presentations aren't *that* common in the average workplace unless your job is in account management, project management, or product management (basically, if your title has management, then it is more likely) or you frequently demo products with the marketing team. Instead of focusing on the presentation part, think more about your skills in confidently explaining your knowledge, exerting influence and persuasive techniques, and articulating complex ideas in different formats.

By mastering these skills through this presentation, you'll be better equipped to excel in your future career, regardless of the specific industry or role you choose.

# LLM Challenge: Descriptions

This project is part of the Descriptions Skill Group (#1), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 1 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

On the last Friday of every quarter, your company hosts a 'creativity day' where employees complete particular challenges to keep their creative spirit fresh. This quarter's challenge is invention and sharpening your skills for visualizing product ideas. Our AI has generated a series of technical descriptions for theoretical inventions. These inventions exist only as text, and their potential remains untapped. Your task is to bring these concepts to life. Based solely on the technical description, create a hand-drawn sketch, diagram, or schematic of the invention. This draft should capture the core functionality and design as you interpret it. Refine your hand sketch into a detailed and polished digital draft using your preferred digital tools (CAD software, 3D modeling, etc.). This should be a presentation-ready visual representation of the invention that we can show the rest of the company at the end of creativity day.

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To exercise creativity and visualization skills by interpreting technical descriptions and translating them into visual representations.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Prompt a generative AI chat to produce a technical description of a new product or invention  
  * Ask 2: Create a hand-drawn sketch or diagram based on the provided technical description.  
  * Ask 3: Refine the hand-drawn sketch into a polished digital draft using digital tools.  
* 

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Primary Audience: Company employees and colleagues attending the Creativity Day event.

The Style: The LLM should provide your descriptions in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) because you need to understand exactly how and why the materials fit together. Functional presentation is more common for trade journals written to explain industry topics to people working in the industry or things like proposals and documentation within a field. Your ReadMe files for code and technical descriptions for the devs and engineering teams are forms of functional work.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To showcase the ability to visualize and communicate technical concepts through visual representations.

* Project completion report.   
  * This memo contains the project retrospective for the LLM Challenge with a review of the objectives, workflow, and lessons learned during the effort.  
* Hand-drawn sketch or diagram capturing the core functionality and design of the invention.  
  * This content contains the first draft and iteration of the design based solely on the LLM output.  
* Polished digital draft of the invention, suitable for presentation.  
  * This content contains the final iteration of the design after refining the LLM output.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. 

* Idea 1: "A self-cleaning umbrella that uses ultrasonic vibrations to repel water and dirt."  
* Idea 2: "A portable device that translates animal sounds into human language."  
* Idea 3: "A gardening tool that automatically adjusts its function based on the type of plant it detects."

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

 

* Genre: [Technical visual](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/introduction-to-technical-graphics/) of a theoretical invention  
* Format: Hand-drawn sketch or diagram and digital draft (e.g., CAD drawing, 3D model, illustration).  
* Design: Primarily visuals with headings and sentences for clarity

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo and Use a generative AI to complete the challenge.

### Requirements

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. Transcript of the chat conversation with the AI to prompt your invention  
3. Drawings that you made based on the prompt with notes for the dimensions, materials, and other relevant specifications  
   1. Photo of your initial hand-drawn sketch ideas  
   2. Final rendering: polished illustration, digital line drawing, 3D model, etc.

Your editing and overall polish will be assessed for skip, scan, skim.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 2 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.    
* The project shows how you worked with an LLM to complete the client contract and develop functional new materials.

## Due Date

Submit your work by February 22. The portal closes on February 24. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of AI-generated content as a tool in professional writing situations  
* Practices applying creative thinking to visualize and iterate on new ideas  
* Practices creating drawings or models of concepts  
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

In the workplace, you will work with others on big projects where kind, honest, helpful, and realistic feedback is vital. You and your co-workers will probably use LLMs and other AI applications to generate content: you need to know the limitations, strengths, and what to improve from the drafts you receive. Also, assessing AI work is not different from assessing an intern's work, so this is good practice for improving the solid foundations they might provide.

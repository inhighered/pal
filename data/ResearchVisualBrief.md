## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by Client experiencing a significant increase in customer complaints regarding the documentation for a recently launched product. Internal and external users find the documents confusing, poorly organized, and lacking essential information. The engineers find the content oversimplified, while the business side feels everything is too jargon-laden for most audiences. The documentation for this product must serve all the stakeholders in the best way possible (engineering team, business team, and end-users/customers). As a technical writer, you have been tasked with assessing the situation and providing suggestions for them to improve their work. You will identify and analyze current research articles on relevant topics (*use the provided articles from the weekly readings OR locate new ones*), synthesize key findings, and apply them to a practical workplace scenario. You will produce a Visual Research Brief with citations of the articles and the project completion report.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goal:  To apply relevant research findings to provide practical solutions for improving the documentation.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Assess the current state of the product documentation.  
  * Ask 2: Identify and analyze relevant research articles on topics related to technical communication, user experience, and information design.  
  * Ask 3: Synthesize key findings from the research and apply them to the client's situation.  
  * Ask 4: Create a Visual Research Brief summarizing the research and recommendations.  
  * Ask 5: Write a project completion report for the firm manager.

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: This is likely a project manager, documentation lead, or someone in a similar role within the client's organization. They have the authority to implement your recommendations. They will be concerned with overall product success, balancing the needs of different stakeholders (engineering, business, customers), receptive to data-driven recommendations and clear action plans.

The Style: You should write your brief in an [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don’t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic. They just need enough to understand the big principles and get the job done.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To provide the client with practical and research-backed solutions for improving their product documentation to enhance user experience and satisfaction. 

* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.  
* Section 1: Overview of the client's situation and the challenges with their current documentation.  
* Section 2: Summary of key findings from relevant research articles.  
* Section 3: Application of research findings to the client's context, providing specific recommendations for improvement.

Topic Ideas:  You need to use scholarly articles (so from the library with research) to draw practical applications. Use the bonus materials from each online reading or locate your own. The sources must be about technical writing and information design.

* Idea 1: Focus on information architecture and organization of technical documents.  
* Idea 2: Explore the use of visuals and multimedia in technical communication.  
* Idea 3: Analyze the principles of user-centered design for creating effective documentation.

 

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

 

* Genre: [Visual Research Brief](https://www.axd.agency/post/how-to-write-a-winning-technology-solution-brief#:~:text=Use%20plain%20language%2C%20avoid%20technical,accessible%20to%20a%20broader%20audience.&text=Get%20straight%20to%20the%20point,than%20a%20few%20pages%20long.&text=Keep%20readers%20engaged%20by%20guiding,with%20clear%20headings%20and%20subheadings.)  
* Format: PDF or a Slide Deck  
* Design: You can write either a more traditional graphic brief (mostly text in paragraph formats) or a SlideDoc: a blend between presentations and written reports, your slide deck is a balance of text and visual elements for a graphic report to be read (not verbally presented).

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo, Design a visual brief that the audience can easily consume, Cite research with information about technical writing that sets up the logic, value, and application of your documentation strategy, Solves the library issue through the researched content, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfil the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts

### Requirements

Your project will be graded on the following required elements:

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. A visual research brief with four content areas:  
   1. Introduce the workplace scenario, outlining the problem in detail.  
   2. Synthesize the key findings from your research articles, emphasizing those most relevant to the scenario.  
   3. Propose a comprehensive revision plan for the document library, drawing on specific evidence from your research to support your recommendations.  
   4. Discuss the potential impact of your proposed revisions on user experience and satisfaction.  
3. A reference list (and you need to cite the work inside your brief) with 8+ relevant research articles.  
   1. You can use the research articles from the weekly readings and/or locate your ACADEMIC-level articles. Any industry or popular sources (websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, etc.) will not be accepted for this assignment because you practice applying scholarly research-level papers.

You are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 4 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.  
* Implemented design tools to produce a highly visual brief in either a graphic word processor style OR a slidedoc style. The audience should recognize this as a visual, written brief.  
* Cites at least 8 sources that clearly relate to technical writing. The citations are informative hyperlinks, footnotes, or in-text/reference list. These references are synthesized to draw connections to the documentation library problem and used to justify the proposed changes. The data supports the brief.  
* Explains how to improve the library by outlining the problem at hand, proposing a revision plan supporting by research, and discussing the impacts of the revisions on user experience to justify the recommendations.  
* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  
* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.

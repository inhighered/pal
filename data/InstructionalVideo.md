# Instructional Video

This project is part of the Media Skill Group (#4), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 4 points. The highest score from the media group will be used with the three lowest or skipped dropped. Students should pick the one media and video production project they want to complete.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by a Client to create a video demonstration for their products. You've been assigned to develop that video that guides potential customers through your product's set-up, instructions, and troubleshooting. Your audience comprises individuals who have purchased or are considering purchasing the product. They may have varying levels of familiarity with similar products, so creating a video that is easy to understand for beginners and informative for those with some prior experience is essential. The video will be posted on the product's promotional website and linked in confirmation emails sent to customers after purchase. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc.

NOTE: This video option is for an intermediate skill level with video. You don't need editing experience, as single takes can capture the demonstration. However, having some tools and knowledge may be needed. 

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To create a video demonstration that effectively guides customers through the product's setup, instructions, and troubleshooting.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Develop a script that outlines the key steps involved in setting up, using, and troubleshooting the product.  
  * Ask 2: Record video footage demonstrating each step clearly and concisely.  
  * Ask 3: Incorporate narration or on-screen text to guide viewers through the process.  
  * Ask 4: Edit the video, adding music, transitions, and visual effects to enhance engagement.  
  * Ask 6: Reflect on the process in a project completion report

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who:  Individuals who have purchased or are considering purchasing the product. They will want a focus on how the technical topic can be applied to real-world problems and challenges they face. They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. They also expect guidance on specific features or troubleshooting.

The Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations–like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  

* Engaging and enthusiastic tone.  
* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  
* Visually appealing and dynamic presentation.  
* Use of storytelling and relatable examples.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

* Section 3: Instructions: Demonstrate how to use the product's various features and functions.  
* Section 4: Troubleshooting: Address common issues and provide solutions or troubleshooting tips.  
* Section 5: Conclusion: Summarize key takeaways and provide contact information for further assistance.  
* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project plan is a formative assessment, which means you are applying concepts and forming skillsets. The assignment designs a slide deck to complement your informative verbal presentation to teach audiences about technical concepts. You are practicing several skills:

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking while manipulating the tools for a video  
* Practices delivery skills and ensures the audience can hear your ideas  
* Practices leveraging persuasive appeals to support learning about topics

Will you make videos at work? Maybe. It depends. Perhaps you will use them as product demos and informational content for the team. Think more about your skills in confidently explaining your knowledge, exerting influence and persuasive techniques, and articulating complex ideas in different formats. 

In small team environments, there may be nobody with video experience or confidence. If you take the time to develop media skills, you could bring extra value.

# Course Policies
This class teaches the basics of technical writing and information design (presenting content) through 10 project options, three (3) reading activity options, and active lab work. Most weeks, you will have work due during class (activities & reflections), Fridays (reading homework), and Sundays (project milestones). You are graded on total points earned and NOT a percentage of the total work. This means you will plan and decide which projects, activities, and skills you want to complete to accrue the corresponding points. 

## Course Description
When you registered for this class, you saw the goal described as “preparing students to write effectively and ethically within technical, scientific, and engineering contexts by applying best practices for technical communication.” You will practice creating, revising, and analyzing various technical communication genres through discussion/participation activities, creative projects, and reading reflections/analysis

You signed up for this course to practice writing and expressing your ideas to make technical information usable. We will build on core technical communication skills to create common and useful documents across STEM contexts. 

## Course Requirements
Success in this class assumes you have several skills already.

### Prior Credits 
* Functional skills in standard American English writing: sentence construction, paragraph structure, spelling/grammar
* ENGL 1308, ENGL 1310, or ENGL1410

### Prior Skills
* Functional technical skills for computer and digital interactions 
* Functional digital information literacy to locate, evaluate, apply, create, and communicate knowledge using technology 

## Materials and Textbook
The course has several required materials to use.

* Access to your campus email account, Canvas, Office 365
* The OER (free, open educational resource) “textbook” I’ve written for this class. Each week, you will read the corresponding chapter that includes written overviews, video lectures to watch, and discussion/notetaking prompts to address. The textbook also includes help pages for the projects this semester to use.
* The technology requirements for the campus. 
* Computers (not Chromebooks) are best for this class because we run Office products. You can complete all the assignments in the 365 Online environment…but it is less powerful with a few missing creative features. We meet in a PC lab for class if you can’t bring a laptop to campus.
* We will use Slido, an interactive meeting tool, during lab sessions. Slido can be accessed from your phone or computer; you do NOT need an account to participate. You will see a QR Code and access PIN to load the Slido Polls during class. Slido collects data on our responses, and you will not be asked to submit sensitive data during a class poll.

## Student Responsibilities
This course is delivered in a hybrid format, which means we meet once per week on campus (Columbine Hall-confirm in your student schedule) with required content online.
Your “Required Materials” are posted to Canvas and should be completed the week assigned. You will need to watch videos, read articles, and take notes on your own time while keeping up with the schedule. Everything is contained in the textbook chapter for that week.
Every 2(ish) weeks, you have an opportunity to earn points with a project. You don’t have to complete every project, but you do need to keep track of your points earned compared to your grade goal: an A = 40 points.

### How to be a successful student

You need to build a weekly routine with the materials and projects.

* Plan ahead with Canvas to-do and schedule your point goals (decide what points you want to try and earn)
* Read the weekly textbook chapter and complete the Lab Check by Friday
* Attend the weekly lab and complete the activity
* Follow the project guidebooks, resources, and samples to complete the work

You should add all due dates to your Outlook calendar, planner, or whatever tool you use to track information. Every assignment is already published so you can work ahead. Technically, you can complete the class as quickly as you want with the one exception of weekly Labs (since they are in-person and once a week).

You also need to practice and own three skills for success. 
* Productivity is the alignment of resources (time, energy, and effort) towards a goal. You need to protect the time and energy you need to balance your workload
* Self-Efficacy is the belief in our abilities to complete a specific goal or task. You need to find and use various resources to foster your learning.
* Agency is	the ability to make choices and act. You need to create a plan and own the outcomes of your choices.


### Behavior and Conduct
I expect you to maintain high ethical and professional conduct standards this semester. While not an “official” part of grading, you must be prepared, contribute to class discussions, and submit work that shows an effort to learn/try and represent yourself honestly. Know that I want you to succeed: your grade is in your control. All the resources, explanations, examples, templates, tools, and knowledge required to ACE this course are available. It is up to you to use it.

Our code of conduct outlines the ethical and social behavior that underlies the principles of the University. Please do your work and support the learning environment of everyone in our class. Note on AI: In this class, you are assessed on applying design and communication tools, not the subject area in your documents. You can use AI to generate and edit the copy (words). Please follow our course AI Policies.

## AI Policies
LLMs are a big tool for writing-focused work with growing research and guidelines. They boost the creative process, spark ideas, and expedite drafting. You will see citations and disclosures from me when I use AI tools, too (I like Gemini the best because of the multiple versions and interface and Grammarly for editing support).

AI tools are allowed to support your critical thinking, research, and creative efforts. You must review and edit the AI-generated content to reflect your goals—and check for hallucinations, inaccuracies, bias, and empty language. You are responsible for using it ethically, checking all references it provides, and citing the AI-generated content.

I expect you to disclose and cite your AI usage.

### AI Disclosure Format
*Use the disclosure format below at the end of your projects where you substantially use an AI Intern to help you craft or write the content.*

The author partially researched or generated this text with [INSERT TOOLS]. The author reviewed, edited, and revised the content to take responsibility for the content. The following prompts were used in this project: [INSERT YOUR PROMPTS]

## Grading Policies
**INTERESTING HISTORY**: grading scales are made up, and we *use* to focus on evaluative feedback instead of letters, percentages, and rankings (many sources, but see Lee, 2020 for a great summary blog). I want you to focus on your strengths, weaknesses, and intrinsic (inside yourself) assessment of your learning more than a number on a screen. But…we all must work within the system…

### How to Earn Points
Generally, our rubrics are broken into Very Effective, Functional, Developing, and Incomplete categories for each skill to demonstrate, which awards skill points. Your grade will show up with that number and a descriptor: Top Notch, Functional, Partial Attempt, Incomplete. Please read the written comments to understand your performance instead of placing all your value on a single number. You will also see an overall comment, written feedback on your rubrics, and annotations on your documents.

Grades are typically posted within ten (10) working days of the due date. If you want to earn more points OR if you miss an assignment, then plan to complete the make-up point opportunities to reach the grade you want. Other priorities, emergencies, procrastination, and life happens: move on if you miss something or score low and plan for the next chance. The make-up point opportunities reflect the core skills from major projects, so you can still practice the outcomes.  

### How to Calculate Final Grades
The points you earn correspond to the letter grade I will input, and it all aligns with our 4.0 scale. An “A” requires earning 40 points, B is 30 points, C is 20 points, and a D is 10 points. The class has a total of 53-points, so you can pick and choose which assignments to complete. Your grade is NOT A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL. I have marked the recommended path to an “A” with a ⭐ icon on the assignment page.

>The course is graded like a video game. You will earn points (think XP) by completing the assignments (think quests) to level up by the end of the semester. Every 10 points will level you up one letter grade.>

The point values follow the general 4.0 “quality points” of the university system. We have 8 levels you can move through this semester: A, A-, B+, B, C+, C, D, and F. The class does not use “-” for final grades lower than an A (-). Canvas may show you a “-” grade, but it will be rounded that to a flat letter for B, C, and D as your final grade. Decimals will be rounded up to the next number. You need to earn 10 points to pass this class.

#### Point Table for Final Grade

You need to earn points to reach your grade. This class is not based on a percentage of ALL work. You can will pick and choose the activities you want to complete to earn the points you need. There are over 50 point opportunities to pick from and build your grade.

A	40 to 53
A-	37 - 39
B+	33 - 36
B	30 - 32
C+	23 - 29
C	20 - 22
D	10 - 19
F	0 - 9

### Late Work Policies

Every assignment has a due date and an automatic 24-hour extension before it closes. Work will only be accepted while the assignment is still open on Canvas. All work will be submitted through Canvas, so please don’t email me copies. Follow the instructions on Canvas for the expected format and file types accepted.

There is no penalty for late work within the 24-hour extension because life happens (emergencies, procrastination, etc). Once the portal closes, it is over and you need to move on to the next point opportunity.

# About the Professor
Dr. Hayley Blackburn goes by Professor HB for this class. She received her education at Colorado State University in Communication, Information Technologies, and Technical and Media Communication. 

She is laid-back and open to working with you; however she does expect and respect your level of effort and agency. She lays out the expectations and you get to choose what to do with those expectations.

## Facts about HB
Sul, sul! Here are a few of her favorite things:

**Video games** --mostly the Sims 4 🚽🔥, quest-heavy open-worlds like Stardew Valley 🐎 or BotW/TotK 🧝, and casual strategy sims like Civ 6🗺️ or City Skylines 🏙️

**Podcasts** -- I like film/tv critics and pop culture conversations (my research is often on podcast culture). My Spotify Wrapped for Podcasts went:

* Who? Weekly
* Mostly Nitpicking
* The RingerVerse
* Trial by Content
* Ringer Dish

**Movies** -- we built a theater room, and I rewatch Lord of the Rings (at least) once a year. My top three MCU runs 1) Winter Soldier❄️🐱‍👤, 2) Black Panther💜, 3) Ragnorak🔨. After that, my A tier has all the Avenger titles and Shang-Chi; B tier has things like Guardians and Captain Marvel; C tier has most of the new phase releases; D tier has The Eternals as the bottom.

**TV**-- streaming only, no commercials. I will always accept this rose🌹, can't believe what the chief stew said⛵, and look forward to the burger of the day👨‍🍳🍔. 

I have a dog--Gatsby🥂--named after the 2012 movie, not the book. My partner, Preston, is an ML Ops Engineer and *may* make a guest appearance to talk about his experiences as a chemical engineer (degree) turned data engineer turned coder.

# Prototype Brief

This project is part of the Descriptions Skill Group (#1), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 1 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Your team has developed a new product, but to secure funding, you need a clear and concise technical specifications document that outlines the product's functionality, features, potential impact, and prototype visuals. The product could be physical (a gadget, a tool, an apparel item) or digital (an app, a software platform, software-as-service). The document you create allows everyone--devs, stakeholders, managers, researchers--to understand the big picture of the product and key details necessary to develop prototypes. The details of your spec sheet will depend on the product type and your role: UX will focus on the experience and design specs, Coders will focus on the language and software specs, Engineers will focus on the functions and physicality, etc. Use the resources to help determine the essential details relevant to your field and product type in the development specification sheet.  

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To guide the development of prototypes based on the provided specifications.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Define the product's purpose and target audience.  
  * Ask 2: Detail the product's features and functionality.  
  * Ask 3: Explain the potential impact of the product.  
  * Ask 4: Include prototype visuals.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Developers, stakeholders, managers, and researchers involved in the product development process.

The Style: They need detailed descriptions of exactly how and why things work, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). Functional presentation is more common for trade journals written to explain industry topics to people working in the industry or things like proposals and documentation within a field. Your ReadMe files for code and technical descriptions for the devs and engineering teams are forms of functional work.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose Statement: To effectively communicate the value proposition of the new product and guide its development.

* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.  
* Product Overview (name, purpose, target audience, and potential impact).  
* Technical Specifications (depending on the product type and your role, e.g., UX/UI, coding languages, hardware components).  
* Prototype Visuals (mockups, diagrams, or 3D models).

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. 

* Idea 1: Physical Product: A smart water bottle that tracks hydration levels and reminds users to drink water.  
* Idea 2: Digital Product: An app that helps users manage their time and improve productivity.  
* Idea 3: Software as a Service: A platform that allows businesses to create and manage online courses.

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

 

* Genre: [Technical specifications document or brief](https://monday.com/blog/rnd/technical-specification/)  
* Format: Primarily text-based with paragraphs  
* Design: A mix of paragraphs and statements with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and visuals on each page.

 

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo, Described the product, purpose, and target users, List the features and functions for user needs, Detail the technical aspects of the product, Enhance descriptions with relevant, clear visual mock ups, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfilled the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts

### Requirements

Your project will be graded on the required elements:

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. A specification sheet with four headings of content:  
   1. *Product Overview:* Briefly describe the product, its purpose, and its target users.  
   2. *Key Features and Functionality*: List the product's primary features and how they function to solve your user's problems  
   3. *Technical Specifications:* Detail the product's technical aspects, such as dimensions & materials (physical products), software requirements and code language/elements (digital products from a CS and coding role), user experience and information infrastructure (app-based products from a UX or technical writer role), or any relevant technical standards. This area will most likely change depending on your career roles and product type.  
   4. *Prototype Visuals:* Include product sketches, diagrams, flowcharts, or images.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 4 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.  
* Completed Product Overview: Defined the product with clarity. The audience should understand who this product is for and why it has market value.	  
* Completed Features and Functionality: Users have enough information to categorize and visualize the item's unique characteristics and novel features. The audience should understand how the product's features solve the specific needs for the readers.	  
* Completed Technical Specs: The product's relevant technical standards provide enough detail and clarity to guide the development team.	  
* Created unique and custom visuals that help users understand each of the items. The visuals must be original (you make them) or have original content added (labels, annotations, edits)	  
* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.	  
* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.	

## Due Date

Submit your work by February 22. The portal closes on February 24. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ‚≠êSuper Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you describe your idea in useful, usable detail for a specific audience.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking to brainstorm and develop NEW ideas and solutions  
* Practices attention to the details that make products/topics/processes unique  
* Practices developing visuals to bring an idea closer to the prototype phase (visualizing on paper what you imagine)  
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

In the workplace, prototyping and technical specification documentation are invaluable tools. Prototyping allows for the visualization of concepts, identification of design flaws, gathering feedback, improved communication and collaboration, and securing of buy-in from stakeholders.  Technical specifications provide clear guidelines, minimize errors and misinterpretations, ensure quality control, guarantee legal and regulatory compliance, and serve as valuable documentation for future reference. Together, these practices streamline product development, save resources, and ensure the creation of high-quality, user-friendly, and compliant products.

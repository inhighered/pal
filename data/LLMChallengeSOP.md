# LLM Challenge: SOP

This project is part of the Instructions Skill Group (#2), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 2 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

On the last Friday of every quarter, your company hosts a 'creativity day' where employees complete particular challenges to keep their creative spirit fresh. This quarter's challenge is invention and sharpening your skills for visualizing product ideas. Our AI has generated a series of technical descriptions for theoretical inventions. These inventions exist only as text, and their potential remains untapped. Your task is to bring these concepts to life. Based solely on the technical description, create a hand-drawn sketch, diagram, or schematic of the invention. This draft should capture the core functionality and design as you interpret it. Refine your hand sketch into a detailed and polished digital draft using your preferred digital tools (CAD software, 3D modeling, etc.). This should be a presentation-ready visual representation of the invention that we can show the rest of the company at the end of creativity day.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To provide the student success and advising center with a finalized Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for implementing the routine.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Generate a routine using generative AI (morning/evening, study, workout/physical activity, or mental health/emotional wellness).  
  * Ask 2: Follow the generated routine for at least three days, documenting effectiveness and needed changes.  
  * Ask 3: Revise the routine based on your experience and feedback.  
  * Ask 4: Create a final SOP document for the client.  
  * Ask 5: Write a project completion report for the firm manager.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: 

* Primary Audience: College students seeking guidance on time management, productivity, and well-being.  
* Secondary Audience: The student success and advising center director and staff.

The Style: You can write the SOP in a more formal [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). The readers need to focus on what to do with relatable reasons why. Be encouraging, relatable, and helpful, and approachable.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To empower students with a structured routine that promotes balance, productivity, and well-being.

* Introduction and explanation of the routine's purpose.  
* Detailed steps of the routine, including specific actions and time allocations.  
* Tips and strategies for successful implementation.  
* Documentation of your experience following the routine, including observations and adjustments.  
* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:

* Idea 1: Morning Routine: Generate a routine that helps students start their day feeling energized and focused.  
* Idea 2: Study Routine: Generate a routine that optimizes study habits and promotes effective learning.  
* Idea 3: Mental Health/Emotional Wellness Routine: Generate a routine that incorporates mindfulness, stress management techniques, and self-care practices.

 

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

 

* Genre: [Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo and Use a generative AI to complete the challenge.

### Requirements

Your project will be graded on the following required elements:

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. Transcript of the chat conversation with the AI to prompt your success routine  
3. A photo or social media post link (highlighted story, TikTok, etc) of you completing at least one stage of the SOP  
4. Final SOP with your revisions, adjustments, and edits

You are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 2 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.    
* The project shows how you worked with an LLM to complete the client contract and develop functional new materials.

## Due Date

Submit your work by March 22. The portal closes on March 24. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ‚≠êSuper Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of AI-generated content as a tool  
* Practices applying creative thinking to visualize and iterate on new ideas  
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

In the workplace, you must develop strong routines and procedures to accomplish tasks while balancing your life. While your company will have SOPs for the stuff inside your job, you must create productivity in your life. How you start and end your days (outside of work) and how you manage your schedule during the workday will set you up for a positive balance or lead to burnout.

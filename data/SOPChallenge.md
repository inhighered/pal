# Standard Operating Procedure Challenge
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the SOP challenge project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, October 27, by Midnight

### Timeline

Prompting your AI intern to develop operating procedures will take just a few minutes. Then, you need to plan 3 days of following that plan and making edits to the procedures before writing your project completion report.

## Grading
You can earn 2 points from this project. 

* 100% or 2  = Complete
* 0 = Incomplete

This project is graded as pass/fail based on the inclusion of the requirements and effort.

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of AI-generated content as a tool
* Practices applying creative thinking to visualize and iterate on new ideas
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset


## Requirements

In this assignment, you will prompt an LLM to generate a routine for college students to follow that will lead to more productivity and success. You can prompt for a morning or evening routine, a study routine, a workout/physical activity routine, or a mental health/emotional wellness routine. Then, you will follow the procedure for at least 3 days while documenting the effectiveness and any needed changes. After three days, you will revise the routine into a final "Standard Operating Procedure" document for your new habits and write the project completion report.

### CAMP Situation
Imagine you're a consultant hired by a struggling college student success center. Student feedback reveals a common theme: they feel overwhelmed, unproductive, and unsure of how to balance academics, social life, and personal well-being. The center director tasks you with developing a solution. You can imagine your finished SOP document being shared with new student orientation on campus to help our new UCCS students start their college careers with productive routines and instructions.

### Components

The submission is a text-based document with your project completion report as a memo and a file with the prompt you used on the AI, a photo of you completing parts of the SOP, and the final product. Your submission will include the required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: Reflect on your experience with this assignment, particularly in prompting for LLM-generated content
* Process Reflection: Discuss how you created the routine based on the prompt, including changes or re-prompts you needed
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field

#### SOP Document
* Transcript of the chat conversation with the AI to prompt your success routine
* A photo or social media post link (arrived story, TikTok, etc) of you completing at least one stage of the SOP
* Final SOP with your revisions, adjustments, and edits

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you must develop strong routines and procedures to accomplish tasks while balancing your life. While your company will have SOPs for the stuff inside your job, you must create productivity in your life. How you start and end your days (outside of work) and how you manage your schedule during the workday will set you up for a positive balance or lead to burnout.

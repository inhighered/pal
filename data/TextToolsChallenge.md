# Text Tools Challenge

This project is part of the Descriptions Skill Group (#1), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 1 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm is piloting a new 'hiring skills test' to assess how well candidates can use the formatting tools in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You are going to complete the assessment by replicating the provided reference page as closely as possible. You are given the copy (the words) and a few assets with the formatting removed. In your document, you determine the excerpt in the reference image and then add all the elements to replicate the reference photo as closely as possible.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: Replicate the provided file as closely as possible to show your skills with word formatting

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Use the reference photo to manipulate the provided copy using advanced formatting tools  
  * Ask 2: Write a project completion report

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: N/A

The Style: N/A

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose Statement: N/A

* Replicate the heading, sidebars, text boxes, diagram, and other elements in this High-Level Concepts page.

 

### PRODUCT: What to Replicate

You are replicating a portion of the screen shown in the reference image from LlamaIndex's document library. To practice design tools and document structuring, you need to identify the excerpted information and replicate every element shown in the photo inside your document.

 

### Files to Use

You can build from these documents that contain the base copy and select assets. See the documents loaded into the Canvas assignment page.

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Reflect on the project in a formal retrospective memo and Replicated the document using the tools.

### Requirements

Your work will be graded based on the following requirements:

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. Replicated document that includes a close match for the header, headings, sidebars/columns, text box, diagram, fonts, colors, and icons.

You must include polished writing, visuals, and design throughout the sections.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 2 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.	  
* Completed: The project closely mirrors the original document to replicate with appropriate updates and elements to demonstrate functional abilities with the tools under practice.	

## Due Date

Submit your work by February 22. The portal closes on February 24. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ‚≠êSuper Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices manipulating text-based processors (Word, Docs) with formatting, images, and diagramming tools  
* Practices attention to detail with an eye for visual design elements  
* Practices problem-solving and critical thinking to accomplish a clear and specific goal  
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

In the workplace, you probably won't directly replicate work like this. Obviously.  But you will likely read documentation--the reference information you had to sort through and understand--and use word processing tools to create documentation. This project is more about the underlying skillsets needed to complete the replication than the product you made.

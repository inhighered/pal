### Skills to Practice
This is a summative assessment, which means you are reflecting on concepts from the entire course. This portfolio asks you to explain course topics while practicing creative thinking and media design.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices technological adaptability by learning/using an interactive products
* Practices writing purpose statements and orienting an audience to the content
* Practices creative thinking by converting written content into new mediums. Have fun with these-- your audience is interested non-experts, and your goal is to engage + explain
* Practices critical thinking and professional awareness for the strategies STEM, Business, and most any workplace writing uses to share actionable, necessary content

## Requirements

You will create a shareable portfolio that houses your video or podcast explanations of 5 technical writing genres or concepts with linked examples. Inside your portfolio, you will describe each idea's audience, definition, features, and best practices. You can use your projects from the semester as examples to verbally discuss the concepts and strategies in videos or podcast/audio clips.


### CAMP Situation
You are a Technical Writer at a boutique consulting firm specializing in technical communication solutions. Your firm has recently noticed a trend among potential clients: a lack of understanding about the diverse applications and value of technical writing. Your manager has assigned you to lead a team in developing a project portfolio that serves as an educational tool for potential clients. The goal is to showcase the firm's expertise and the wide range of technical writing services you offer while also highlighting the positive impact that effective technical communication can have on businesses and organizations.

### What to Submit and Turn In
Submit a link to your digital portfolio with new media content (videos or podcasts) to explain the technical writing genres and concepts.

* Project Completion Report

* Portfolio Link

### Components to Include
The submission will be a link to the digital portfolio as an interactive, multi-media platform. Inside of your digital portfolio, you will provide the content. Your submission will include the required elements:

## Reason for this Project
I'm not going to pretend that portfolios are common in the workplace for most of your chosen majors. But you may need to explain concepts and build an archive of informational materials. You might also end up in consulting roles with potential clients questioning what value you offer.

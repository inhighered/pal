# Drawing Descriptions AI Challenge
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the prototype descriptions project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, October 27, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 2-3 hours to complete. 
* It will take a few minutes to prompt the AI intern for the description to draw. 
* Then, you will try creating the line drawings
* and writing the project completion report.

## Grading

You can earn 2 points for completing this project. 

This project is graded pass/fail based on meeting the requirements and overall effort.

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of AI-generated content as a tool in professional writing situations

* Practices applying creative thinking to visualize and iterate on new ideas
Practices creating drawings or models of concepts

* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset


## Requirements

In this assignment, you will prompt an LLM to generate a technical description of an unknown invention for you to create as a drawn diagram, schematic, or 3D model. You must create a hand-sketch first draft and then a digital second draft. The invention must be a physical product--not an abstract concept--so that you can draw what the tangible thing might look like with dimensions and material labels.

### CAMP Situation
On the last Friday of every quarter, your company hosts a 'creativity day' where employees complete particular challenges to keep their creative spirit fresh. This quarter's challenge is invention and sharpening your skills for visualizing product ideas. Our AI has generated a series of technical descriptions for theoretical inventions. These inventions exist only as text, and their potential remains untapped. Your task is to bring these concepts to life. Based solely on the technical description, create a hand-drawn sketch, diagram, or schematic of the invention. This draft should capture the core functionality and design as you interpret it. Refine your hand sketch into a detailed and polished digital draft using your preferred digital tools (CAD software, 3D modeling, etc.). This should be a presentation-ready visual representation of the invention that we can show the rest of the company at the end of creativity day.

### Components

The submission is a text-based document with your project completion report as a memo and a file with the prompt you used on the AI, a photo of your hand sketches, and the final product. Your submission will include 3 required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: Reflect on your experience with this assignment, particularly in prompting for LLM-generated content.
* Process Reflection: Discuss how you created the drawings or models based on the prompt, including changes or re-prompts you needed.
* Applications: Explain how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field
#### Transcript of the chat conversation
* Include all the prompts to the AI including followups and clarifications
#### Drawings 
Add the progression of your work based on the prompt with notes for the dimensions, materials, and other relevant specifications
* Photo of your initial hand-drawn sketch ideas
* Final Mock-Ups: digital line drawing, polished illustration, 3D model, etc.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you will work with others on big projects where kind, honest, helpful, and realistic feedback is vital. You and your co-workers will probably use LLMs and other AI applications to generate content: you need to know the limitations, strengths, and what to improve from the drafts you receive. Also, assessing AI work is not different from assessing an intern's work, so this is good practice for improving the solid foundations they might provide.

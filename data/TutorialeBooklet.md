## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by New Student Orientation at a university to create a static digital (but could be printed out) resource that teaches a student success hack using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace tools. They've requested a graphically designed and informative booklet to help the new students use their productivity apps in novel, supportive ways. They do NOT want general descriptions of how the software works or what it does because the IT Department has already created basic guides and descriptions (plus the software documentation libraries provide this general information, too). They also requested an explanation of the digital accessibility tools available in the app. Your contract is to produce a PDF booklet in a verticle format that guides their students step by step through a tutorial on a student success hack using these productivity suites. 

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To teach a "student success hack" using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace tools. This implies you need to find a specific, useful technique that leverages these tools to help students improve their academic performance or organization.

The Asks:

* The client specifically requested that you do not provide general descriptions of the software. You need to explain how to use the tool to accomplish a specific, student-focused procedure.  
  * You must include information about digital accessibility tools.  
  * The final deliverable must be a PDF booklet in a vertical format.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: New university students. Consider their potential needs and challenges as they transition to college life. They may be unfamiliar with the university's technology resources as their highschool may have been a Google or a Microsoft school, which is different from the university. Assume they have basic computer skills but may not be advanced users of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.

The Style: They need clear, step-by-step instructions with visuals to guide them through the chosen tutorial, so you should write this product in an [Interpretive Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don’t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic. They just need enough to understand the big principles and get the job done. Be encouraging, relatable, and helpful, and approachable. You can be a little silly and creative because the target audience is first-time first-year students (\~18 years old). 

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose Statement: You can succeed in college using this specific feature/technique within Microsoft 365/Google Workspace. This tutorial guides you through each step to create XYZ for your success.

* Introduce the "student success hack" and explain its benefits.  
* Provide a clear, step-by-step tutorial on how to implement the hack.  
* Highlight relevant digital accessibility tools within the chosen application.  
* Offer a troubleshooting guide for common errors or issues.  
* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:

* How to organize class notes with formatted headings and collaborate (live-edit) with a classmate in Word/Docs  
* How to manage assignment due dates in Microsoft Planner  
* How to track grade changes over the semester with a graph in Microsoft Excel/Sheets  
* How to set up a study group and schedule virtual study sessions in Microsoft Teams or Discord  
* How to build a study and time management schedule in Outlook Calendar/Google Calendar  
* How to create flashcards with different media options in Microsoft Notes  
* *For other ideas, please confirm with the project manager (Prof HB)*

## Due Date

Submit your work by March 22\. The portal closes on March 24\. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension \- 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you direct user action through a series of steps to help them complete a specific goal. You are writing instructions while working on your visual strategy to help people scan content.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices writing clear and complete commands that direct action  
* Practices critical thinking and empathy to broaden user experiences  
* Practices visual generation and visual thinking/communication of ideas  
* Practices reflecting on a creative process

User guides, tutorials, procedures, and instructions are the most common and likely forms of technical writing to encounter in every job and personal life. As you create instructions, you also learn how to read and use this genre better (writing can make us better readers, just as reading helps us be stronger writers).

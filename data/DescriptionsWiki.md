# Descriptions Wiki
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the Descriptions Wiki project as a quick reference to print (or print to PDF if you want to download) Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, September 22, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 3-5 active working hours to complete.

* Create your Wiki Entries, including the visuals (2-3 hours)

* Write the memo about the project (1-2 hours), leaving time to revise your products.

## Grading

You can earn 6 points from this project. Earning 4.2 points reflects a "Complete" score as the benchmark for success.

The grade is based on four areas with a high expectation given the resources, support, and material for you to use:

* Area 1 is worth 3 points. You are graded on how successfully you completed the required components. If you are missing any of the required elements, you will receive 'no marks' here.
* Area 2 is worth 2 points. You are graded on the presentation of information based on your editing, design, and overall display of content. If your work looks like an essay instead of technical writing, you will receive a 'no marks' here. 
* Area 3 is worth .5 point. You are graded on the CAMP situation based on how will your project fits with the Context, Audience, Message, and Product of the workplace scenario provided. 
* Area 4 is worth .5 point. You are graded on the impression and impact of your work based on skill, class concepts, effort, and creative details that has a little wow.

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you describe objects, software, and processes in useful, usable detail for a specific audience.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching new software options and justifying the choice
* Practices attention to the details that make products/topics/processes unique
* Practices prioritizing information and translating technical content to audiences
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset


## Requirements

You are creating a workplace wiki with a home page that describes what the wiki software does and then two example entries of technical descriptions. You will describe a mechanical product and a chemical/biological/physical/environmental process. Each entry will contain an extended definition, a technical visual to show the concepts you describe, and an explanation of how the topic functions. You will also write a retrospective memo detailing how you accomplished the project objectives, why you adopted that wiki software with other creative choices in the project and things you learned from the experience.

### CAMP Situation
You are trying to complete a project that fills this scenario. 

You work for a start-up, and your current task is to set up a Wiki for team documentation and reference library. You are responsible for creating the first two entries (one about equipment and one about a technical process) and ensuring the Wiki is useable to everyone in the start-up. Additionally, other co-workers will contribute entries related to their roles, so explaining how the Wiki operates with best practices and tips is essential. Think about your coworkers, Karen and Richard, who may feel uneasy about adopting new technology. The description of the Wiki should be detailed, and any questions or concerns they may have about empowering their workflow should be anticipated.

### What to Submit and Turn In

The submission will be the public link to your Wiki site and a 1-2 page memo explaining your Wiki-building process. 

### Components to Include
Your submission will include 5 required elements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: how you met the objectives of the project
* Process Reflection: why you made your creative choices and selected the software for the wiki
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field

Use the Introduction to Project Management lecture notes to help you with this requirement.

#### A Wiki home page that provides:
* Welcome: the purpose and orientation to the library you've created
* Software Description: how the Wiki software works so your co-workers understand the tool
* Best Practices: for writing technical descriptions so your co-workers add quality entries

Use the Introduction to Technical Writing and the Introduction to Structure lecture notes to help you with this requirement.

#### Extended definition and a detailed explanation of the mechanical functions and specifications for the object/equipment Wiki Entry

Use the Introduction to Technical Writing and the Introduction to Structure lecture notes to help you with this requirement.

#### Extended definition and detailed explanation of the stages in a series for the process (non-instructional) Wiki Entry
* Select a chemical process, biological process, physical (like physics), electrical circuit, or environmental process. Do not create a step-by-step tutorial for a human-task.

Use the Introduction to Technical Writing and the Introduction to Structure lecture notes to help you with this requirement.

#### Generate at least one of each visual type with a caption:
* Photo, Rendering, or Illustration
* Table
* Diagram or Flowchart

Use the Introduction to Technical Visuals lecture notes to help you with this requirement.

## Reason for this Project
You are completing this project because in the workplace, technical descriptions provide detailed information about a product, technology, or system. They typically include information about how the product is used and works and its key features and capabilities. While descriptions are rarely standalone documents (unless in your company's wiki or documentation library), the sections describing unfamiliar material often appear in guides, reports, briefs, and product marketing materials. An extended description is a building block for many other documents.

## Examples and Help

Return to the Canvas assignment page for links to sample projects, templates, worksheets, and guide materials to help you iterate (brainstorm), draft, assess, revise, and proof your projects. 

You have access to the following help information:

* Sample from HB with a Build Video
* A sample from a past student
* Professional examples from the workplace
* Templates to fill in the information in a Microsoft Word and a Google Drive format
* Frequently Asked Questions Page with the challenges and questions from past students
* Project manual with the written tips and support based on each requirement and step in this project.

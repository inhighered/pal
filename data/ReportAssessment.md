# Report Assessment
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the Report Assessment Challenge project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, December 15, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 3-5 hours. You will need to carefully read the report document while taking notes on the rubric items. Then you need to analyze your notes, consider the impact of the writing, and create your written analysis. You will end with a project completion report.

## Grading

You can earn 3 points from this project. 

* 90% or 2.7 = "Top Work"

* 70% or 2.1 = "Complete"

* 50% or 1.5 = "Attempt"

* <50% = "Incomplete"

* 0 = Skipped

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of work to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a document
* Practices applying the technical writing mindset to assess the structure, language, persuasion, and details of a document
* Practices identifying AI-generated content as a tool in professional writing situations

## Requirements

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of formal proposals by critically analyzing an example created with the assistance of a Large Language Model (LLM). You will assess the proposal's effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and practice applying the concepts we've discussed in class, with a particular focus on the impact of AI tools in technical writing.

### CAMP Situation
Imagine you are a technical writer working for a consulting firm. Your client, a higher education advocacy group, wants to propose a new degree type to university officials through an article at the Chronicle of Higher Education. They have drafted a proposal and asked you to evaluate the document and provide feedback. You suspect that the group heavily utilized an LLM in creating the proposal, so you asked them to explain their creative process. They provided a video commentary on the edits to reference as you further assess the work.

### Components

The submission is a text-based document with your completed cover letter, written proposal analysis, and a copy of your suggested edits/comments. You should combine all the files into a single submission. Your submission will include the required elements:

#### A formal cover letter for the client that introduces your analysis and reflects on the work you completed for them
* Work Assessment: Reflect on your experience with this assignment, particularly in evaluating LLM-generated content.
* Process Reflection: Discuss what you learned about formal proposals, technical writing, and the role of AI in the field.
* Applications: Explain how this assignment has helped you develop your skills and understanding of technical communication in the context of emerging technologies.


#### Written Analysis (1000-1200 words)
* Introduction: Briefly summarize the proposal's purpose and context, noting the use of an LLM in its creation.
* Strengths: Identify and analyze the proposal's most effective elements. Support your claims with specific examples from the text and cite relevant course materials (textbook, lectures, articles). Discuss how the use of an LLM may have contributed to these strengths.
* Weaknesses: Identify and analyze areas where the proposal could be improved. 
* Consider the limitations of LLM-generated content and explain how these may have contributed to the weaknesses. Support your claims with examples and citations.
* Recommendations: Based on your analysis, provide actionable recommendations for revising or strengthening the proposal, taking into account the ethical and practical considerations of using AI in technical writing.
* Conclusion: Summarize your overall assessment of the proposal and reiterate your key recommendations. Discuss the broader implications of AI in technical communication and the importance of critical evaluation of LLM-generated content.
* 4+ sources from the class materials (lectures, videos, articles, workshops) cited in the analysis with a formal reference list at the end of your written analysis.

#### Edited copy of the proposal with your notes and comments added

Download and save the proposal to then make comments/notes on the content. You can use the "Commenting" features in Word and Google Docs--make sure you submit your copy with all the comments and highlights visible.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you will work with others on big projects where kind, honest, helpful, and realistic feedback is vital. You and your co-workers will probably use LLMs and other AI applications to generate content: you need to know the limitations, strengths, and what to improve from the drafts you receive. Also, assessing AI work is not different from assessing an intern's work, so this is good practice for improving the solid foundations they might provide.

# LLM Challenge: Report

This project is part of the Research Skill Group (#3), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 3 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by a higher education advocacy group that wants to propose a new degree type to university officials through an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education. They have drafted a proposal and asked you to evaluate the document and provide feedback. You suspect that the group heavily utilized an LLM in creating the proposal, so you asked them to explain their creative process. They provided a video commentary on the edits to reference as you further assess the work. You take all their materials and return a written analysis with comments on their work to help them improve their proposal.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To provide constructive feedback on a potentially LLM-generated document.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Evaluate the draft proposal provided by the advocacy group.  
  * Ask 2: Provide written analysis and feedback to improve the proposal.  
  * Ask 3: Write a formal cover letter explaining your work to the client

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: The advocacy group is the client and primary audience who will read your analysis of their proposal.  They are passionate about their cause and invested in the success of the proposal, may have biases that could affect their judgment of the proposal's effectiveness, and are expecting you to provide objective and expert feedback on their writing.

The Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don’t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning. You are explaining technical writing standards and the ethics of AI in this case as a scholarly level using sources from class.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To help a higher education advocacy group refine their proposal for a new degree type.

* Open with a formal cover letter addressed to the advocacy group explaining that you completed the work  
* Section 1: Briefly summarize the proposal's purpose and context, noting the use of an LLM in its creation.  
* Section 2: Identify and analyze the proposal's most effective elements. Support your claims with specific examples from the text and cite relevant course materials (textbook, lectures, articles). Discuss how the use of an LLM may have contributed to these strengths.  
* Section 3: Identify and analyze areas where the proposal could be improved. Consider the limitations of LLM-generated content and explain how these may have contributed to the weaknesses. Support your claims with examples and citations.  
* Section 4: Based on your analysis, provide actionable recommendations for revising or strengthening the proposal, taking into account the ethical and practical considerations of using AI in technical writing.  
* Section 5: Summarize your overall assessment of the proposal and reiterate your key recommendations. Discuss the broader implications of AI in technical communication and the importance of critical evaluation of LLM-generated content.

 

### PRODUCT: Materials to Review

* Genre: [Formal Business Letter](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/basic_business_letters/index.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

Download a personal copy of the proposal and review your client's video on their creative process to complete the project.

## Graded Requirements

To earn full credit, you need to Write a formal cover letter that summarizes the report addressed to a relevant stakeholder, Analyze the SWOT of the proposal, Cite research with information about technical writing that sets up the logic, value, and application, Use editing tools and techniques for correct, polished writing in combination with document design, Fulfill the expectations of the client contract and mock scenario with professional impacts. 

### Requirements

Your project will be graded on the following required elements:

1. A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:  
   1. *Work Assessment:* how you met the objectives of the project  
   2. *Process Reflection:* why you made your creative choices and solved problems during the project  
   3. *Applications:* how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field  
2. Written Analysis (1000-1200 words): analyze your notes and then write about the work  
   1. *Introduction:* Briefly summarize the proposal's purpose and context, noting the use of an LLM in its creation.  
   2. *Strengths:* Identify and analyze the proposal's most effective elements. Support your claims with specific examples from the text and cite relevant course materials (textbook, lectures, articles). Discuss how the use of an LLM may have contributed to these strengths.  
   3. *Weaknesses:* Identify and analyze areas where the proposal could be improved. Consider the limitations of LLM-generated content and explain how these may have contributed to the weaknesses. Support your claims with examples and citations.  
   4. *Recommendations:* Based on your analysis, provide actionable recommendations for revising or strengthening the proposal, taking into account the ethical and practical considerations of using AI in technical writing.  
   5. *Conclusion:* Summarize your overall assessment of the proposal and reiterate your key recommendations. Discuss the broader implications of AI in technical communication and the importance of critical evaluation of LLM-generated content.  
3. 4+ sources from the class materials (lectures, videos, articles, workshops) cited in the analysis with a formal reference list at the end of your written analysis.

You are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 4 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Follows expectations of a formal cover letter. The content explains the creative process and personal reflections on LLMs in this type of workplace situation.  
* Find and explain the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats when analyzing the proposal as written. The analysis leads to clear and logical recommendations to improve the quality of the proposal's content and writing from a technical writer's perspective.  
* Cites at least 4 sources that clearly relate to technical writing. The citations are informative hyperlinks, footnotes, or in-text/reference list. These references are used synthesized to draw connections to proposal writing and used to justify the proposed changes. The data supports the analysis.  
* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  
* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.

## Due Date

Submit your work by April 26. The portal closes on April 28. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of work to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a document  
* Practices applying the technical writing mindset to assess the structure, language, persuasion, and details of a document  
* Practices identifying AI-generated content as a tool in professional writing situations

In the workplace, you will work with others on big projects where kind, honest, helpful, and realistic feedback is vital. You and your co-workers will probably use LLMs and other AI applications to generate content: you need to know the limitations, strengths, and what to improve from the drafts you receive. Also, assessing AI work is not different from assessing an intern's work, so this is good practice for improving the solid foundations they might provide.

# Research Brief
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the Research Brief project as a quick reference to download. Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, December 15, by Midnight

### Timeline

This project should take 1-2 hours...if you've been reading the research articles weekly. If not, you must read the research papers, take notes, and then write the brief (5+ hours). Once you've read all the research articles, you will write the brief and your project completion report.

## Grading

You can earn 3 points from this project. 

* 90% or 2.7 = "Top Work"

* 70% or 2.1 = "Complete"

* 50% or 1.5 = "Attempt"

* <50% = "Incomplete"

* 0 = Skipped

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices analyzing research findings to assess their application to professional scenarios (critical thinking)
* Practices applying research-based knowledge to address specific challenges (problem-solving)
* Practices present your research findings and recommendations in a useful, useable, enjoyable product

## Requirements

This assignment challenges you to delve into the scholarly discourse surrounding technical writing. You will identify and analyze current research articles on relevant topics (use the provided articles from the weekly readings OR locate new ones), synthesize key findings, and apply them to a practical workplace scenario. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to bridge theory and practice, utilizing research-backed insights to address real-world communication challenges. You will produce a Research Brief with citations of the articles and the project completion report.

### CAMP Situation
Your company is experiencing a significant increase in customer complaints regarding the documentation for a recently launched product. Users—both internal and external—find the documents confusing, poorly organized, and lacking essential information. The engineers find the content oversimplified, while the business side feels everything is too jargon-laden for most audiences. The documentation for this product must serve all the stakeholders in the way best for their needs (engineering team, business team, and end-users/customers). As a technical writer, you have been tasked with revising the document library to improve user satisfaction and support the whole company.

### Components

The submission will be a 2-3 page PDF for the brief and a 1-2 page PDF as your project completion report. Your submission will include the 3 required elements

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details
* Work Assessment: Reflect on your experience with this assignment, particularly in applying research to practical situations.
* Process Reflection: Discuss what you learned about reading for the arguments, findings, and implications of research articles
* Applications: Explain how this assignment has helped you develop your skills as a professional in your field


#### A research brief with four content areas:
* Introduce the workplace scenario, outlining the problem in detail.
* Synthesize the key findings from your research articles, emphasizing those most relevant to the scenario.
* Propose a comprehensive revision plan for the document library, drawing on specific evidence from your research to support your recommendations.
* Discuss the potential impact of your proposed revisions on user experience and satisfaction.


#### A reference list (and you need to cite the work inside your brief) with 8+ relevant research articles.

You can use the provided research articles from the weekly readings and/or locate your own ACADEMIC-level articles. Any industry or popular sources (websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, etc.) will not be accepted for this assignment because you are practicing applying scholarly research-level papers.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, you will need to rely on information--from popular to industry to your own research projects--to make data-driven decisions. Often you are expected to document your research findings as a justification for the decisions and recommendations you make. This project is most applicable for those of you interested in graduate school and higher-level roles where access to academic knowledge is more common.

# Learning Proposal

This project is part of the General Skill group, so the points will contribute to your overall total.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm begins every intern's journey with a proposal for their goals and plans during the session. Your first task is to look ahead to the contracts and projects available and plan for what you want to complete. Consider the point values, skills, outcomes, and your final achievements. What grade do you want to earn? How will you accrue the necessary points to reach that goal? You will write a formal memo containing a proposal's core contents to document the what, how, and why of your work plan this semester.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To strategically select projects and contracts to achieve desired learning outcomes and accrue necessary points.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Review available projects, considering point values, skills, and outcomes.  
  * Ask 2: Determine your desired grade for the internship.  
  * Ask 3: Develop a plan to accrue the necessary points to achieve the target grade.  
  * Ask 4: Explain the rationale behind your project choices and how they align with your learning goals.  
* 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Internship supervisor or manager. Write it to me and assume that I understand the parameters of the course, all the projects, and the tools available. I also expect you to be concrete, detailed, and realistic with your plan for being successful in this class. You get to define what success means, so ensure you explain what you want to get out of your time this semester.

The Style: I want detailed descriptions of exactly how you will accomplish your learning plan, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic’s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners–people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.

* Formal and professional tone.  
* Clear and concise language.  
* Goal-oriented and results-driven approach.  
* Demonstrated understanding of the program and its requirements.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose Statement: To communicate your commitment to the internship and present a well-defined plan for achieving success during the semester.

* Section 1: Internship Goals: State your overall goals for the internship, including desired skills, knowledge, and experience.  
* Section 2: Target Grade: Clearly state the grade you aim to achieve.  
* Section 3: Work Plan: Outline your plan for completing projects and contracts, specifying which ones you intend to pursue and why.  
* Section 4: Point Accumulation Strategy: Explain how your chosen projects will contribute to accumulating the necessary points for your target grade.  
* Section 5: Timeline and Milestones: Provide a tentative timeline for completing projects and achieving milestones.

Consider what you want you earn in the course and the focus you want to pursue.

* I want an "A"- Earning an 'A' requires 40 points, with at least 4 points from each project group. The most efficient path to this goal is completing every Big Project (26 points) and all the participation (15 points). Then select small projects to make up any lost points.

 

* I want to focus on Engineering Projects-While all of the genres, skills, and practices in this course contribute to STEM career paths, I recommend focusing your attention on the following assignments as MORE catered to practical engineering careers (*but you can make any assignment related to engineering*): Reference Library, Tutorial eBooklet, LLM Challenge: Descriptions, AI Challenge: SOP, Progress Report, Recorded Presentation, Recommendation Report, and keep up with all the participation.  
* I want to focus on Computer Science and Dev Projects- While all of the genres, skills, and practices in this course contribute to STEM career paths, I recommend focusing your attention on the following assignments as MORE catered to digital and computer application careers (*but you can make any assignment relate to CS*): Reference Library, Technical Video or Video Demo, Tutorial eBooklet, Prototype Brief, Progress Report, Usability Report, and keep up with all the participation.  
* I want to spend minimal time and effort while still passing--Respect. The lower-point assignments are also easier and faster to complete because they require less creativity and concept application (but you will still practice the core skills). If you want to get by with a passing "C" grade in an efficient, easy way, I recommend focusing on all the participation points and a few small projects to earn your 20 total points.  
* I'm a technical writing major or minor: Yay! Happy to have you in the program! You should follow the "A" path to get experience across all the major contexts. And then complete the Text Tools Challenge and the Design Tools Challenge to practice with our core software.

 

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Proposal](https://www.unco.edu/research/pdf/grant-writing-websites-docs/developing-and-writing-proposals/AliceReidGuide.pdf)  
* Format: Text-based document contained within a [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

   * Resources you'll utilize (e.g., textbooks, online resources, study groups)  
3. Grade Breakdown: Based on the course grading rubric, how will you earn the grade you desire? Be specific! For example:  
   * "I will earn an A on all major projects by carefully following instructions, revising my work thoroughly, and seeking feedback."  
   * "I will actively participate in class discussions and contribute meaningfully to peer reviews."  
4. Contingency Plan: What will you do if you encounter unexpected challenges or fall behind schedule? (e.g., "If I struggle with a particular concept, I will seek help from the instructor or a tutor.")

You are also graded on the work's overall polish, editing, and professional impact.

## Due Date

Submit your work by February 1. The portal closes on February 3. You must upload a PDF containing your project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. 

* Practices defining desired outcomes that are ambitious and realistic  
* Practices identifying key milestones based on projects, documents, and multi-month timelines  
* Practices developing a strategy for managing time and resources  
* Practices proposal writing that presents a clear, concise, and persuasive plan

Identifying, explaining, and then executing detailed plans/goals is a central part of success in.... well, anything. When people talk about "strong communication skills" for the job, it is often referring to this ability: can you explain and follow a plan to get your job done?

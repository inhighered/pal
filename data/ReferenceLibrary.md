This project is part of the Descriptions Skill Group (\#1), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 1 points.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired to build a Reference Wiki for a client company. They asked us to research wiki software, write documentation on how employees use that software, and create sample entries as a model. They want one mechanical product and one chemical/biological/physical/environmental process as examples. Each entry will contain an extended definition, a technical visual to show the concepts described and an explanation of how the topic functions. You will also write a project completion report addressed to me as the firm manager detailing how you accomplished the project objectives and reflecting on your effort.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To create a user-friendly Reference Wiki for company employees. This means the wiki should be easy to navigate, search, and understand.

* Research and recommend suitable wiki software for the client company.  
* Provide clear documentation on how to use the chosen wiki software.  
* Create exemplary wiki entries showcasing the desired content and format.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Research and recommend wiki software for the client.  
* Ask 2: Write documentation on how to use the wiki software.  
* Ask 3: Create two sample wiki entries (one mechanical, one chemical/biological/physical/environmental).  
* Ask 4: Write a project completion report addressed to the firm manager.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Client company employees who will be using the wiki. You should pick a real company (or make up your own business) to determine the audience's needs, culture, and vibe. The employees are generally knowledgeable about their field and are looking for detailed descriptions of topics in their profession as a quick reference on the job.

The Style: They need detailed descriptions of exactly how and why things work, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic’s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners–people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: This wiki is a valuable resource for all employees, providing clear and concise information about our company's work. 

* Documentation: Create user guides and tutorials on how to use the wiki software.  
* Model Entries: Develop two comprehensive entries with extended definitions, technical visuals (diagrams, flowcharts, etc.), and explanations of how things function.  
* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. 

* Manufacturing: CNC Milling Machine, Industrial Robot, Injection Molding Machine  
* IT: Server Rack, Network Switch, High-Performance Computing Cluster  
* Laboratory: Electron Microscope, Spectrophotometer, Gas Chromatograph  
* Chemical: Polymerization, Catalysis, Electrolysis  
* Biological: Fermentation, Cell Culture, Photosynthesis  
* Physics: Heat Transfer, Fluid Dynamics, Optics  
* Electrical Circuit: Signal Processing, Power Distribution, Analog-to-Digital Conversion  
* Environmental: Water Treatment, Air Pollution Control, Waste Management

*\*Ideas generated by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro. Prompt: create a list of topics that meet the requirements in this assignment..." 2025\.*

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 6 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Followed the standards for a memo with correspondence information. Responses are complete and detailed statements about the project outcomes. Writing is organized in a usable, useful, and enjoyable way. I understand how you planned, completed, and reflected on your work and lessons learned.

* Implemented a wiki software that organizes pages of information while using features and tools for user experience. The audience should understand what the product can do and what best practices or tips they should follow when creating entries. As the company expands the library, the pages should remain consistent and useful.

* Defined the item with clarity. Users have enough information to categorize and visualize the item's unique characteristics, including the specifications/dimensions. The audience should understand what the object can do, how it mechanically works, and how much space it physically takes up.

* Defined the process with complete clarity. Users should understand how the process moves forward through stages with inputs and outcomes. The description stays focused on what is happening within the non-instructional, technical process or cycle.	

* Created unique and custom visuals that help users understand each of the items. The visuals must be original (you make them) or have original content added (labels, annotations, edits).	

* Strictly followed copyright laws and industry norms in the use of all content within the library. You cited information and data as needed to credit the original authors. With visuals, you used images from approved CC or licensed work with artist credits OR noted your copyright for original visual content.	

* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.

* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.		

## Due Date

Submit your work by February 22\. The portal closes on February 24\. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension \- 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you describe objects, software, and processes in useful, usable detail for a specific audience.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching new software options and justifying the choice  
* Practices attention to the details that make products/topics/processes unique  
* Practices prioritizing information and translating technical content to audiences  
* Practices meta-cognition to critically reflect on work output, personal process, and a growth mindset

In the workplace, technical descriptions provide detailed information about a product, technology, or system. They typically include information about how the product is used and works and its key features and capabilities. While descriptions are rarely standalone documents (unless in your company's wiki or documentation library), the sections describing unfamiliar material often appear in guides, reports, briefs, and product marketing materials. An extended description is a building block for many other documents.

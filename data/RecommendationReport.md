# Recommendation Report

This project is part of the Research Skill Group (\#3), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 3 points. Only one of the report options will count for credit, so students need to select between the Recommendation OR the Usability Report. Do not attempt to complete both as the scope and work is larger than the timeline for this class.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm is working with a think tank in your field (a collection of thought leaders and researchers tasked with solving problems).  A client asked the think tank to help them decide between two potential solutions to an issue with sustainability, equity, or economic impacts in their field. Given the current technological, social, and economic climate, you’ve found the leading TWO solutions and are researching the best option. You address a formal letter to the actual organization or person who influences this field (the stakeholder who contracted the think tank). Your letter needs to identify the work filled in and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and oriented toward actions. Then, the report shows the highest level of formality with background research, clear methods, data for each criterion used to compare the solutions, and the final recommendation.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goal:  To conduct thorough research and analysis to determine the most suitable solution considering the current technological, social, and economic climate.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Identify the top two solutions to the client's issue.  
  * Ask 2: Develop clear criteria for comparing the solutions.  
  * Ask 3: Conduct in-depth research on each solution, considering their feasibility and impact.  
  * Ask 4: Analyze each solution against the defined criteria using data and evidence.  
  * Ask 5: Formulate a clear recommendation with justification.  
  * Ask 6: Write a formal letter to the client, highlighting the credibility and value of the report.

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: The client organization or individual who contracted the think tank. This could be a government agency, a business leader, or a prominent figure in the relevant field with the authority to make decisions based on your recommendations. They will be concerned with the ROI and feasibility of the solution. They will also expect clear, actionable recommendations with a strong justification.

The Style: You will write this in a [Scholarly Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). It is a way of explaining things to people who need to REALLY, really know a topic, including all the history, influences, and little details. Since the reader of a scholarly presentation is expected to have a lot of prior knowledge and motivation for engaging with the work, we don’t necessarily stop to define every specialized term and will use that jargon as shortcuts that still keep the very niche in meaning.

* Formal and professional tone for both the report and letter.  
* Clear, concise, and objective language in the report.  
* Persuasive and confident tone in the letter.  
* Use of visuals (charts, graphs, screenshots) to support findings.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose: To provide the client with a well-researched, data-driven recommendation on the most suitable solution to their problem, empowering them to make informed decisions.

* Formal Letter: Summarize the project, highlight key findings, and persuade the client of the report's value and credibility (this will be the cover of your document)  
* Section 1: Introduction: Clearly define the client's issue and the scope of the research.  
* Section 2: Background Research: Provide context by summarizing existing literature and data related to the issue and potential solutions.  
* Section 3: Methodology: Describe the criteria used to evaluate the solutions and the data sources used for analysis.  
* Section 4: Solution Analysis: Present a detailed analysis of each solution against the defined criteria, supported by data and evidence.  
* Section 5: Recommendation: Clearly state the recommended solution and provide a strong justification based on the analysis.

Topic Choices: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:

* Idea 1: Sustainability: A city government needs to choose between implementing a congestion charge or investing in public transportation to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.  
* Idea 2: Equity: A technology company is deciding between two different approaches to increase diversity and inclusion in its workforce.  
* Idea 3: Economic Impacts: A national government is considering two different policies to stimulate economic growth after a recession.  
*

### Grading Criteria

The project is worth a maximum of 8 points. You can receive partial credit based on the completion of skills and graded criteria. Successful projects will meet the following graded criteria and expectation:

* Follows expectations of a formal cover letter. The content explains the creative process and personal reflections on LLMs in this type of workplace situation.  
* Completed the front matter: Cover page provides a descriptive title and author information. The abstract summarizes the big picture of every section with a clear explanation of the results.  
* Completed Navigation: Used document tools for crisp and accurate content that shows major sections and the locations of figures/tables. The alignment, formatting, and labels are polished with professional standards.  
* Completed introduction and background to report: A purpose statement implies the goal and content of the report. The problem is summarized with some data points and context. The background and reasoning for why this matters and should be studied is provided with data and researched logic. I quickly and easily followed your justification and context for weighing solutions to find a final recommendation.  
* Completed Methods Sections: 3 criteria or areas of research are identified. The evaluation standards are mostly explained for clarity, validity, and reliability about how and why the criteria are measured. I quickly and easily found the criteria and how you planned to compare the solutions with the data.  
* Completed Research: Describes the process of collecting brand-new data with enough clarity for readers to gauge validity and reasoning. The most important details are provided, such as the questions, materials, and steps in the process. I see how you practiced making new data to answer your research question and contribute to the knowledge on your topic.  
* Completed Analysis Sections: The recommendation makes sense and is argued based on the data and analysis. The results from each criterion are provided and summarized in the discussion. The reader can connect the dots and should come to a similar conclusion based on the data. I clearly and quickly found your analysis with how it mirrors the methods/criteria.  
* Completed References: 10 appropriate sources are cited in the text and the reference list following formal APA or IEEE conventions. The variety and use of sources shows dedication to curiosity, validity and diversity of perspectives, and a real deep dive to learn more. I clearly and easily found your citations, which made me feel confident in your research abilities.  
* Complete Figures and Tables: Created or curated visuals that are meaningful to the content, data, or key points. Wrote clear story in the caption or surrounding text. The caption expands on the context rather than repeating title information only. I see how you used a variety of technical graphics to show the impact of data and information in the report.  
* Used language that generally conveys meaning and has sparse errors. It seems like an editing tool was used and design tools that complement the text. I can clearly see your attention to detail, effort in proofing, and use of class concepts.  
* The final product adheres to the mock professional situation and demonstrates your creativity, professionalism, and effort.

## Due Date

Submit your work by April 26\. The portal closes on April 28\. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension \- 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you are analyzing data to provide logical, ethical decisions shared in a formal report format.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching and writing a formal solutions-focused report as common in many STEM and business careers  
* Practices creating summary and navigational tools that signal formality and usefulness to the reader  
* Practices prioritizing and summarizing information for the audience to understand the need for technical knowledge for a problem-solving situation  
* Practices problem-solving and creative thinking by recognizing a problem and generating viable solutions with criteria to judge/compare the usefulness  
* Practices designing research methods and contributing new data to a decision  
* Practices locating and synthesizing information for a data-driven decision-making process

In the workplace, formal report writing varies depending on your situation. Typically, the higher-level managers and leaders will be responsible for writing the reports and interacting with clients, stakeholders, investors, boards, etc. 

*Note: if you H.A.T.E researching and writing reports, then this is a good opportunity to evaluate what your primary career goals are and the responsibilities of that job title.* Perhaps that isn't your career goal.

However, the ability to analyze and compare options before making a decision (and documenting that work less formally) can be used in your personal, professional, and academic life. When in doubt... figure out the background and criteria and weigh the options accordingly.

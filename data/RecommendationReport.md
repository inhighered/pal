## Due Date

Sunday, December 8, by Midnight

### Timeline

This is the biggest project of the semester and may take 8-13 active hours.

* (2-3 hours): research and log your sources

* (1-2 hours): analyze sources and weigh your solutions

* (5-8 hours): write ~4,000 words of content while leaving time to design and revise the report

## Grading

* 90% or 7.2 = "Top Work"

* 70% or 5.6 = "Complete"

* 50% or 4 = "Attempt"

* <50% = "Incomplete"

* 0 = Skipped

### Skills to Practice

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. In this project, you are analyzing data to provide logical, ethical decisions shared in a formal report format.

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices researching and writing a formal solutions-focused report as common in many STEM and business careers
* Practices creating summary and navigational tools that signal formality and usefulness to the reader
* Practices prioritizing and summarizing information for the audience to understand the need for technical knowledge for a problem-solving situation
* Practices problem-solving and creative thinking by recognizing a problem and generating viable user testing data to recommend improvements/solutions
* Practices designing research methods and contributing new data to a decision
* Practices locating and synthesizing information for a data-driven decision-making process

## Requirements

You are reporting primary (you generate data) and secondary research to directly compare the solutions on 3 standards (think effectiveness, costs, logistics, social perceptions, acceptability, etc.). You will write a formal recommendation report detailing your research results, targeted toward decision-makers on the topic. You write a cover letter addressed to that stakeholder.

### CAMP Situation
You work for a think tank in your field (a collection of thought leaders and researchers tasked with solving problems).  A client asked the think tank to help them decide between two potential solutions to an issue with sustainability, equity, or economic impacts in their field. Given the current technological, social, and economic climate, youâ€™ve found the leading TWO solutions and are researching the best option. 

You address a formal letter to the actual organization or person who influences this field (the stakeholder who contracted the think tank). Your letter needs to identify the work filled in and persuade them that your report is credible, helpful, and oriented toward actions. Then, the report shows the highest level of formality with background research, clear methods, data for each criteria used to compare the solutions, and the final recommendation.

### Components

The document will be around 10-20 single-spaced pages TOTAL (including all front, body, and back matter). The font should be a professional and standard 11-14 body size in a classic serif or sans-serif. Within the report, you are required to include:

* Formal cover letter addressed to a relevant stakeholder-- pick a real body to address the letter
* Title page with all citation information (author, date, publisher) --so people can cite your report in their work
* A descriptive Abstract or Executive Summary that provides an overview of the purpose and key content
* Well-formatted table of contents and list of figures/tables
* Orientation to the situation: introduction and a problem/background section
* Explanation of criteria and methods for the research where you Describe the procedures for completing your Expert Interview, Survey, Experiment, or Case Study analysis. You must have primary research (you generate new data); and Select 3 criteria from this list: costs, building timeline, productivity, efficiency, public perception, success rates/effectiveness, safety, environmental impacts, weight/size, materials, durability, other/topic-specific
* Discussion of the research with the final recommendation
* Reference List with 10+ sources in APA or IEEE format
* Appendix with the raw materials from your primary research
* Provide at least two visuals representing data or concepts (graphs, tables, illustrations, diagrams, renderings)

You must include polished writing, visuals, and design throughout the sections. This dense report must be skippable, scannable, and skimmable for the stakeholder.

## Reason for this Project
In the workplace, formal report writing varies depending on your situation. Typically, the higher-level managers and leaders will be responsible for writing the reports and interacting with clients, stakeholders, investors, boards, etc. 

Note: if you H.A.T.E researching and writing reports, then this is a good opportunity to evaluate what your primary career goals are and the responsibilities of that job title. Perhaps that isn't your career goal.

However, the ability to analyze and compare options before making a decision (and documenting that work less formally) can be used in your personal, professional, and academic life. When in doubt... figure out the background and criteria and weigh the options accordingly.

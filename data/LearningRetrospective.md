# Learning Retrospective

This project is part of the General Skill group, so the points will contribute to your overall total.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm sent you to a professional development conference on document design and tools. In exchange for the trip and several days away from the office, your boss asks you to create a summary for your colleagues that explains what you learned. You need to develop a report that summarizes the key concepts from each conference session (the materials within a unit this semester), explains how the sessions connect to each other, and offers actions for your team to improve the quality of reports produced. You will create a formal memo summarizing what you learned with the team.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

**The Goals:** To share knowledge gained from a professional development conference on document design and tools with colleagues.

**The Asks:**

* Ask 1: Summarize the key concepts from each conference session in the module (the weeks within Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3)  
  * Ask 2: Explain how the concepts from different sessions relate to each other and contribute to effective document design.  
  * Ask 3: Develop actionable recommendations for the team to implement the learned concepts and improve report quality.  
    

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: Colleagues at the technical writing firm. They are likely other technical writers, editors, or content developers within your firm. They understand the challenges and demands of technical writing.  Some may be experienced in document design, while others may be newer to the field. Some may be interested in specific tools, while others may focus on broader design principles. They want to know how the information from the conference can be applied to their daily work to improve the quality of their documents.

The Style: I want detailed descriptions of exactly how you will accomplish your learning plan, so you should write this in a [Functional Style](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/). This form of presentation focuses on the topic’s practical components using jargon. The functional description is meant for practitioners–people directly working with the subject who need to really understand how and why it works. They are expected to have prior knowledge and motivation to understand the topic, including familiarity with specialized terms.

* Formal and professional tone.  
* Clear and concise language.  
* Goal-oriented and results-driven approach.  
* Demonstrated understanding of the program and its requirements.

 

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

**Purpose Statement:** To enhance the team's understanding of document design principles and tools, leading to improved quality and effectiveness of the firm's reports.

* Section 1: Introduction: Briefly describe the conference and its focus.  
* Section 2: Session Summaries: Summarize the key takeaways from each session, focusing on practical applications.  
* Section 3: Connecting the Dots: Explain how the concepts from different sessions relate to each other and contribute to a holistic approach to document design.  
* Section 4: Recommendations for Improvement: Provide specific and actionable recommendations for the team to implement the learned concepts in their work.

You only need to pick one of the Unit's this semester to discuss the topics learned within. You can pick from:

* Group 1 on Describing  
* Group 2 on Instructing  
* Group 3 on Reporting

### PRODUCT: Final Expectation

* Genre: [Formal memo](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/memos/parts_of_a_memo.html)  
* Format: Text-based document  
* Design: Primarily sentences and paragraphs with headings, lists, and tables for skip, scan, skim

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. 

* Practices synthesizing information to distill it into key takeaways for their colleagues  
* Practices connecting concepts to see the big picture and understand how different principles work together

A formal memo isn't just about getting the information across; it's also about presenting it in a clear, concise, and polished way that reflects well on the writer and their organization. This is a key skill in any professional setting.

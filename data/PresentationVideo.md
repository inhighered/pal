# Instructional Video

This project is part of the Media Skill Group (\#4), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 4 points. The highest score from the media group will be used with the three lowest or skipped dropped. Students should pick the one media and video production project they want to complete.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

The local "Pitch for Good" competition has issued its CFP and theme. This is your chance to secure funding for a STEM, education, or health-focused project that addresses a pressing social challenge on behalf of your think tank and firm.  The judges are looking for novel ideas that connect to equity, sustainability, and other cultural issues to improve conditions for most people. The competition requires you to submit a compelling verbal proposal as a pitch video for investors and legislators. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc.

NOTE: The top 5 pitches will advance to the voting round of the competition, where the public provides input. The top 3 pitches will be awarded for their work to claim on portfolios.\*\*Seriously though, I will decide on the Top 5 in the class to advance to a voting round with your classmates (not the actual public). I will send out a form with the pitches for the class to review and vote for the last two weeks of class. The winner will be notified during finals week and receive 1 point plus a certificate for your LinkedIn portfolio. If you are selected, you can opt-out if you don't feel comfortable.\*\*

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To create a persuasive pitch video that effectively communicates the project's value and potential impact.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Identify a pressing social challenge related to equity, sustainability, or other cultural issues.  
  * Ask 2: Develop a novel project idea that addresses the chosen challenge using STEM, education, or health-focused approaches.  
  * Ask 3: Create a persuasive pitch video that outlines the problem, proposed solution, and potential impact.  
  * Ask 4: Reflect on the process in a project completion report

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who:  Judges of the "Pitch for Good" competition (investors and legislators). This is your most critical audience, as they hold the power to decide whether your project receives funding. They are likely to be a mix of individuals with expertise in STEM, education, health, social impact, and investment. They want to see fresh, creative solutions to pressing social challenges. Your idea needs to stand out. They'll evaluate your project based on its potential to create meaningful, positive change in the community. While your project has a social good focus, the judges will also be looking for evidence of a sound plan, including feasibility, scalability, and potential for long-term impact.

The Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations–like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  

* Engaging and enthusiastic tone.  
* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  
* Visually appealing and dynamic presentation.  
* Use of storytelling and relatable examples.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

* Section 3: Impact and Feasibility: Highlight the potential benefits and demonstrate the project's feasibility.  
* Section 4: Call to Action: Persuade the judges to invest in the project and support its implementation.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site.

## Due Date

Submit your work by April 19\. The portal closes on April 21\. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension \- 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project plan is a formative assessment, which means you are applying concepts and forming skillsets. The assignment designs a slide deck to complement your informative verbal presentation to teach audiences about technical concepts. You are practicing several skills:

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking while manipulating the tools for a customized deck  
* Practices delivery skills and ensures the audience can hear your ideas  
* Practices leveraging persuasive appeals to support learning about topics  
* Practices designing a handout to accompany presentations

Formal presentations aren't \*that\* common in the average workplace unless your job is in account management, project management, or product management (basically, if your title has management, then it is more likely) or you frequently demo products with the marketing team. Instead of focusing on the presentation part, think more about your skills in confidently explaining your knowledge, exerting influence and persuasive techniques, and articulating complex ideas in different formats.

By mastering these skills through this presentation, you'll be better equipped to excel in your future career, regardless of the specific industry or role you choose.

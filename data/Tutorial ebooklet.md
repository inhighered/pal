## Requirements

You are creating a digital booklet that guides your readers through the step-by-step process of completing your chosen task. The goal is to practice your technical writing skills by presenting clear, concise, and easy-to-follow instructions. Your digital eBooklet should be visually appealing, incorporating images, diagrams, and special tips/notes to enhance the learning experience. The eBooklet will be a comprehensive resource, providing detailed step-by-step instructions, relevant visuals, and a troubleshooting table.


### CAMP Situation
You are trying to complete a project that fits into this scenario.

Your company's content marketing team is developing a "Ways our Product Makes Your Life Easier" campaign for something you sell. You've been assigned to develop a digital booklet that guides potential customers through your product's set-up, instructions, and troubleshooting. Your audience comprises individuals who have purchased or are considering purchasing the product. They may have varying levels of familiarity with similar products, so creating a booklet that is easy to understand for beginners and informative for those with some prior experience is essential. The booklet will be hosted on the product's promotional website and linked in confirmation emails sent to customers after purchase.

The project manager also wants you to document how you considered digital accessibility in your booklet design and the SWOT of your creative process. You write a memo to the manager detailing your experience.

### Components

Your booklet must be submitted as a .pdf file extension, appropriate for digital reading and printed access. The dimensions should be in a 1.6:1 ratio (vertical book about mobile phone width), the Kindle industry standard for eBook files. Your eBook must contain the following requirements:

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: how you met the objectives of the project
* Process Reflection: why you made your creative choices and considered digital accessibility in your work
* Applications: how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field
#### Title page with: 
* the prompt
* relevant visual
* and a small Table of Contents
#### Purpose of your tutorial
* how the product you chose is helpful to the audience
#### Summary of the set-up:
* required tools
* and any other preparation materials
#### Detailed instructions
* explain each step of the tutorial (~8-12 steps)
#### Visuals that guide user understanding of the task with annotations for clarity
#### Troubleshooting or FAQ section
* anticipate problems the user may encounter (3+ topics)

You must include polished writing, visuals, and design throughout the sections.

## Reason for this Project
User guides, tutorials, procedures, and instructions are the most common and likely forms of technical writing to encounter in every job and personal life. As you create instructions, you also learn how to read and use this genre better (writing can make us better readers, just as reading helps us be stronger writers).

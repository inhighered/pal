# Technical Video
This plain-text file provides the basic information for the Technical Video project as a quick reference to print (or print to PDF if you want to download) Please return to the main Canvas page for files, videos, and links to resources.

## Due Date

Sunday, September 29, by Midnight

### Timeline

The video should take 2-4 hours to complete IF you have some prior experience with a video editor. Otherwise I would expect it to take longer.

The time also depends on what type of video you choose to make, as fully narrated with animation would take more time than a to-camera vlog style, etc.


## Grading

You can earn 6 points from this project. 

* 5.4 points, 90% = "Top Work"
* 4.2 points, 70% = "Complete"
* 3 points, 50% = "Attempt"
* <50% = "Incomplete"
* 0 = Skipped

### Skills to Practice
This project plan is a formative assessment, which means you are applying concepts and forming skillsets. The assignment designs a slide deck to complement your informative verbal presentation to teach audiences about technical concepts. You are practicing several skills:

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking while manipulating the tools for a video
* Practices delivery skills and ensures the audience can hear your ideas
* Practices leveraging persuasive appeals to support learning about topics


## Requirements
You produce an informative video to teach your viewers any technical or writing-focused topic. The video needs to include narration/audio, so YOU verbally explain the topic, and a variety of visuals to enhance understanding. Since you need to produce a video, you must create and upload your storyboard or shotlist to show your planning on the process. Your video must include some cuts and edits rather than a single take. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so you can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc. Do not upload the video to Canvas.

### CAMP Situation
The content marketing department has tasked you with creating an informative and educational video on a technical topic to be shared on the company's website and social media channels. Your target audience includes high school and university students, as well as those in the early stages of their STEM careers. Your mission is to choose a technical topic that you're passionate about and present it in an engaging and informative way.

The video should be clear, concise, and easily digestible for viewers with varying levels of expertise. Use real-world examples, visuals, and storytelling to make your topic relatable and interesting. Whether it's artificial intelligence, renewable energy, cybersecurity, or any other technical subject, your goal is to spark curiosity and enthusiasm for STEM. Remember, this video is your opportunity to showcase your knowledge and passion. Make it informative, inspiring, and engaging, and you'll leave a lasting impression on the next generation of STEM leaders.

### What to Submit and Turn In
Create a 3-6 minute video with audio and visuals (b-roll, etc) to explain any technical topic or writing concept.

Project Completion Report

Storyboard for Video Concept

Short, produced video (3-5 minutes)


### Components to Include

The submission will be a link to your video recording and a PDF upload for the handout. Your video should meet the following requirements

#### A formal memo as your project retrospective that details:
* Work Assessment: Reflect on your experience with this assignment, particularly with finding visuals to enhance the verbal explanation for a video.
* Process Reflection: Discuss how you planned your storyboard, recorded your content, and produced the final video.
* Applications: Explain how the skills, technology, and experiences from this project will help you improve as a professional in your field

#### Storyboard or Shot List
Show the planning and production effort (obviously, do this first to ACTUALLY plan your video)

#### 3-6 Minute Video, published to YouTube, Stream, Vimeo, etc.

* Explain the topic verbally and visually using logos (logic), pathos (connection), and ethos (credibility)

1. Introduce yourself and your topic

2. Explain the history, context, and developments of your topic

3. Describe why or how your topic is applicable for the audience

* Adjust your vocal variety (speed, rate, tone)
* Edits, screen changes, b-roll, and visual production elements


## Reason for this Project
Will you make videos at work? Maybe. It depends. Perhaps you will use them as product demos and informational content for the team. Think more about your skills in confidently explaining your knowledge, exerting influence and persuasive techniques, and articulating complex ideas in different formats. 

And in small team environments, there may be nobody with video experience or confidence. That could be an opening for you to bring extra value if you take time to develop media skillsets.

# Technical Video

This project is part of the Media Skill Group (#4), so the points contribute to the overall total and the Group 4 points. The highest score from the media group will be used with the three lowest or skipped dropped. Students should pick the one media and video production project they want to complete.

Students should refer to the links, resources, rubrics, and other complete information on Canvas. They can schedule office hours with the professor through the Office Hours link on the Canvas homepage or by email at hblackbu@uccs.edu. 

## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by a Client to create an informative and educational video on a technical topic to be shared on the company's website and social media channels. Your target audience includes high school and university students and those in the early stages of their STEM careers. Your mission is to choose a technical topic that you're passionate about and present it in an engaging and informative way. The video must include narration/audio—so YOU verbally explain the topic—and various visuals to enhance understanding. Your video must include some cuts and edits rather than a single take. The final video will be 3-6 minutes long and will be submitted as a link so I can view it on YouTube, Vimeo, Stream, etc  
.  
NOTE: This video option is designed for those with an existing video experience, skill, interest, and equipment. I recommend selecting the more beginner-friendly options if you have not produced and edited a video before. 

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Goals: To create an informative and educational video on a technical topic.

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Choose a technical topic that you are passionate about.  
  * Ask 2: Write a script that explains the topic in an engaging and informative way.  
  * Ask 3: Create or curate visuals (images, animations, diagrams) to enhance understanding.  
  * Ask 4: Record narration/audio to accompany the visuals.  
  * Ask 5: Edit the video, incorporating cuts and transitions, to create a dynamic and engaging final product.  
  * Ask 6: Reflect on the process in a project completion report

 

### AUDIENCE: The Who and Style

The Who: High school and university students, early-career STEM professionals. Some may be highly motivated and advanced in STEM subjects, while others may be just starting to explore these fields. They will want a focus on how the technical topic can be applied to real-world problems and challenges they face. They will also expect you to cater to different learning preferences by using a variety of visuals, examples, and explanations. You are welcome to incorporate current trends, memes, or popular culture references (where appropriate) to make the video relatable.

The Style: They need to connect with the topic and understand how it might apply to their experiences, so you should write your script in an [Affective Style.](https://pressbooks.pub/hayleyinhighered/chapter/intro-to-technical-writing/) This doesn't mean to overly simplify or make it non-technical... it means sharing an experience and really relating to the audience. It is the most easily understood by the widest audience type and is meant to create a connection, show the use-value, and generate interest in a topic. The audience is generally assumed to be a bit unmotivated or unsure how and why the topic is useful or related to them. This style is most useful as a strategy inside of larger presentations–like stopping to explain how the product can be used or a solution is so valuable to fund. I do use an affective style during lectures and workshop activities when teaching as a way to introduce and help show the connections with our concepts to your careers or personal life.  

* Engaging and enthusiastic tone.  
* Clear and concise language, avoiding jargon.  
* Visually appealing and dynamic presentation.  
* Use of storytelling and relatable examples.

### MESSAGE: The Purpose and Content

Purpose Statement: To produce a high-quality video suitable for sharing on the client's website and social media channels that educates and fosters interest in chosen topic.

* Section 1: Introduction to the topic and its significance.  
* Section 2: Explanation of key concepts and principles.  
* Section 3: Real-world applications and examples.  
* Section 4: Potential career paths or further learning opportunities.  
* Project Completion Report: Reflect on your experience, including challenges faced and lessons learned.

Topic Ideas: Here are some ideas of acceptable topics that will meet the CAMP site. Select one of the prompts below:

* Idea 1: The Basics of Artificial Intelligence: Explain the fundamental concepts of AI, its applications, and its potential impact on society.  
* Idea 2: How Renewable Energy Works: Explore different types of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) and how they generate electricity.  
* Idea 3: The Wonders of the Human Brain: Delve into the complexities of the brain, its functions, and how it shapes our thoughts and behaviors.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project plan is a formative assessment, which means you are applying concepts and forming skillsets. The assignment designs a slide deck to complement your informative verbal presentation to teach audiences about technical concepts. You are practicing several skills:

When completing this project, you should focus on several skills related to the workplace:

* Practices creative thinking while manipulating the tools for a video  
* Practices delivery skills and ensures the audience can hear your ideas  
* Practices leveraging persuasive appeals to support learning about topics

Will you make videos at work? Maybe. It depends. Perhaps you will use them as product demos and informational content for the team. Think more about your skills in confidently explaining your knowledge, exerting influence and persuasive techniques, and articulating complex ideas in different formats. 

In small team environments, there may be nobody with video experience or confidence. If you take the time to develop media skills, you could bring extra value.

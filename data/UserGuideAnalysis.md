## Project Scope

Our technical writing firm has been hired by a Client to assess their user guides for a product and offer suggestions on improvements. You are tasked with reviewing their guide, conducting audience research on their market, identifying areas for improvement on their materials, and recommending revisions. This might involve simplifying the language, restructuring the content, adding more visuals, or even suggesting different formats like videos or quick-start guides. You take all their materials and return a short written analysis with instructions on how they can improve their documents.

*The first step of ANY project is setting up the CAMP site. This section breaks down the assignment scenario into the key components: CONTEXT, AUDIENCE, MESSAGE, and PRODUCT. This will help you understand the client's needs and how to approach this technical writing project.*

### CONTEXT: The Goals and Asks

The Asks:

* Ask 1: Thoroughly review the client's current user guides (find an example of a product guide to analyze)  
  * Ask 2: Conduct audience research to identify the target audience's demographics, technical skills, and information needs.  
  * Ask 3: Analyze the user guides, considering clarity, organization, language, visuals, and overall effectiveness.  
  * Ask 4: Develop specific recommendations for improvement, which may include simplifying language, restructuring content, adding visuals, or suggesting alternative formats.

It is like the more simplified version of the scholarly and the functional and meant for audiences who are just learning about a topic or only kind of need to know how and why things work. They don’t necessarily THE details to really KNOW, know the topic. They just need enough to understand the big principles and get the job done.

## Due Date

Submit your work by March 22. The portal closes on March 24. You must upload a PDF containing your retrospective memo and project.

Plan to submit a few hours before the due date to give yourself a buffer for the unexpected. You can use the 48-hour extension/grace period if something comes up. If you miss the grace period, you missed the project. You can use the ⭐Super Extension - 5/13 for one missed project.

## Skills and Outcomes

This project is formative, meaning you apply concepts and form your skills. If you complete this activity, you will demonstrate technical skills to identify writing genres, apply effective design for usability, and research sources for credible information.

* Practices critical analysis and evaluation of work to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a document  
* Practices applying the technical writing mindset to assess the structure, language, persuasion, and details of a document

In the workplace, you will work with others on big projects where kind, honest, helpful, and realistic feedback is vital. People will give you documents and works-in-progress with the expectation that you help them improve the final product.
